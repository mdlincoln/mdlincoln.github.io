<div class="content">
	<p>After my experience with the unstructured un-conference model last weekend, I was interested to read Adam Richardson’s thoughts on <a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2013/06/boosting_creativity_through_co.html">constraints and creativity</a> in Harvard Business Review. I liked this analogy:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In Silicon Valley start-ups a common philosophy these days is “mobile first”: create the mobile app or mobile version of the web site before you do the “full” version. Partly this is driven by the fact that many of these start-ups’ customers will be accessing the new service primarily through a mobile device, and may never look at the web site on a desktop browser. But a side benefit is that a phone’s small screen forces discipline about what’s really critical to communicate to the customer, and which functionality customers will really need.</p>

</p>
<div class="content">
	<p>You should be able to tell from my posts on <a href="http://matthewlincoln.net/2013/06/07/thatcamp-prime-2013-day-1.html">day 1</a> and <a href="http://matthewlincoln.net/2013/06/08/thatcamp-prime-2013-day-2.html">day 2</a> of <a href="http://chnm2013.thatcamp.org">THATCamp Prime 2013</a> that I really enjoyed my time there. I came away with new contacts, fresh ideas, and some clearer signposts as to which skill paths I should pursue. That said, I also came away with tempered expectations for my next THATCamp experience a more critical outlook on the ebullient rhetoric surrounding the un-conference model. Take a look at <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23thatcamp">#THATCamp on Twitter</a> to get a taste of the bubbly enthusiasm.</p>

<h2 id="a-play-space-does-not-replace-a-work-place">A play space does not replace a work place</h2>

<p>THATCamp prides itself as being a play space, a zone whose deliberate lack of structure enables creativity. The <a href="http://chnm2013.thatcamp.org/thatcamp-101/">un-conference model</a> THATCamp adopts is a powerful one: the session schedule is decided during breakfast, people are encouraged to walk in and out of sessions as they please, the participants are responsible for shaping their own experience and that of all the other attendees. The un-conference model addresses the well-rehearsed issues endemic to “traditional” conferences like <a href="http://www.collegeart.org/conference/">CAA</a>, <a href="http://www.rsa.org/?page=2014NewYork">RSA</a>, or <a href="http://www.mla.org/convention">MLA</a>.</p>

<p>This isn’t a magical formula for productivity, however. At my well-attended session, we had a very lively discussion of visualizing geographic and temporal information. Yet it was wide-ranging and unstructured almost to a fault, from my perspective. We touched briefly on many relevant issues, but I came away without any concrete tools to use for my project. Many people chorused their interest in the problem, but we were often at cross-purposes in hashing out guidelines for such visualizations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>We agreed on the truism that a good visualization cannot show everything at once, and so must be designed with different facets or discovery layers.</li>
  <li>We could not agree if granular data access could be married to large-scale data visualization. I firmly believe it should be, in the interest of both transparency and utility, but I and others who advocated this encountered strong pushback.</li>
  <li>We also could not agree how to classify different levels of uncertainty, particularly when it comes to data drawn from secondary sources (this disagreement may have been born of disciplinary differences, which I address below.)</li>
</ul>

<p>This debate is in part due to the intractability of the question I posed, so I probably shouldn’t be overly surprised at the outcome. And simply coming to understand that there are difficult choices to be made in these kinds of visualizations <em>is itself</em> a productive result, of a kind. However the experience also clarified for me how important it is to complement the freeform play space of THATCamp with a more strictly-focused group to hash out the difficult, specific labor demanded by an individual project.</p>

<h2 id="multi-disciplinarity-wont-necessarily-offer-answers-to-intra-disciplinary-questions">Multi-disciplinarity won’t necessarily offer answers to <em>intra</em>-disciplinary questions</h2>

<p>The strength of this particular THATCamp’s multi-disciplinarity was, for me, its weakness as well. As I suggested above, there were some big methodological differences between the participants in our panel. It’s good to challenge the basic assumptions of your research, but it does take up <em>a lot</em> of time. I found myself having to explain why dates and locations derived from works of art are as legitimate as those found from text resources, an argument that would never have to be articulated among art historians. Similarly, I had to explain the basic art historical questions of the history and transmission of visual forms as I was trying to explain why anyone would be interested in establishing a large-scale visualization of when artists were in what cities. This is not a waste of time; an academic must always be able to explain their work to any audience. But disciplinary borders have their value in certain settings, and if anything, I came away from THATCamp better appreciating how multi-disciplinary work can complement, but not replace, deep immersion in a focused field.</p>

<h2 id="how-would-my-next-session-go-differently">How would my next session go differently?</h2>

<p>I’d emphasize again that I don’t think either of these are problems THATCamp ought to <em>solve</em>. But I am glad to draw lessons from this first experience, and I will be keeping these limitations in mind when preparing for future un-conferences. I’m eager to see if a discipline-specific version of THATCamp, like <a href="http://caa2013.thatcamp.org">THATCamp CAA</a> would resolve the disciplinary problems I met this weekend. (I’m sure it would come with its own drawbacks, as well.)</p>

<p>If I propose another session in the future, I will also be more thoughtful in enumerating a smaller or narrower challenge. Far from stifling creativity, I think a little more specificity on my part may have allowed participants to bring their varied and valuable perspectives to bear more <em>quickly</em> and <em>productively</em>, perhaps producing something as actionable as Jeffery McClurken’s <a href="http://chnm2013.thatcamp.org/notepads/swat-team-for-old-dh-sites/">outline for a SWAT Team for abandoned DH websites</a>.</p>

<p>Which is all to say, then, that I am now equally energized both for the hard work to be done on my specific projects, as well as for the possibilities of future THATCamps.</p>

<p>After a long and inspiring day at THATCamp, I’ve been relaxing by trying my hand at a little georeferencing of one of my <a href="http://s.mound.free.fr/longuenesse/cartes/hondius1611.jpg">favorite maps</a>.</p>

	<p>Day 2 of THATCamp Prime 2013! After <a href="https://twitter.com/matthewdlincoln/status/343357548373614593">narrowly avoiding a single-tracking transit disaster</a>, it was another packed day:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>First up was a session on using <a href="http://chnm2013.thatcamp.org/notepads/scripting-for-humanists/">scripting languages in humanistic research</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The most interesting part of this session for me was the minor methodological debate between making custom, but easy-to-use script GUIs accessible to the just-barely initiated digital humanists, versus pressing DH scholars to learn at least the basics of these core languages and tools much as they would learn a foreign language relevant to their area of study. Though I’d come in an advocate of the former, I found myself swayed to the latter by the end of this session.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A great point was made that, much as good scholars practice and publish for posterity, so must they code (and comment!) so that their work can be understood and expanded upon later. This was yet another example I’ve run into during this conference of the practical parallels between “traditional” humanities and the practice of coding.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A last great insight for me was the <a href="https://twitter.com/matthewdlincoln/status/343377156161798144">uncomfortable imperative of sharing our code-in-progress</a> (a counter-_example to the humanities-coding similarity argument.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also, I need to check out the data-cleaning tools available at <a href="http://openrefine.org/">OpenRefine</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Next up was a helpful introductory workshop on <a href="http://www.qgis.org">QGIS</a>, the open-source alternative to products like ArcGIS. This was run by Fred Gibbs, who’s posted <a href="http://fredgibbs.net/blog/maps/getting-started-with-qgis/">a helpful introduciton</a> to the software. I can’t wait to <a href="https://twitter.com/matthewdlincoln/status/343402096403558400">do some georeferencing of my own</a> now.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Lunch was accompanied by an invigorating discussion with Eric Remy and <a href="www.kurtluther.com">Kurt Luther</a> about the interactions between histories of art, science, and music.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I tried my hand at R for a while, but finding it not so relevant to my own work I switched over a group of <a href="http://chnm2013.thatcamp.org/notepads/swat-team-for-old-dh-sites/">guerilla web archivists</a>. I came in a bit late to the game, but these guys and gals really seem to mean business, so I’d get in touch if you’re interested.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I will be posting up a synthetic reaction to this, my first THATCamp, a bit later on.</p>

<p>Some bullet points from my personal experience of <a href="http://chnm2013.thatcamp.org/">THATCamp Prime 2013</a> day one follow. Others’ mileage may vary:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Even an “un-confernece” has to pay its dues by opening with lengthy speeches praising influential and instrumental individuals, but the introductory session was also peppered with some delightful “dork shorts” - not ill-advised clothing, but lighting presentations of projects. I vote for <a href="https://twitter.com/KathrynTomasek">the woman who busted out two wicked erudite limericks</a> while doing a coffee-induced jig.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Though I must also give a close second to <a href="http://twitter.com/jenserventi">Jen Serventi</a> who showcased the NEH’s <a href="https://securegrants.neh.gov/publicquery/">searchable database of successfully funded DH projects</a>. In case you were wondering, there are <em>virtually no</em> art history DH grants out there…</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My session on visualizing uncertainty got accepted, and it was standing/floor-sitting room only! Thanks to everyone who participated (and thanks especially to the individuals who took the lion’s share of notes on the Participad <a href="http://chnm2013.thatcamp.org/notepads/session-notes/">attached to our page</a>.)</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>I loved how quick our group was to engage both sides of the visualization coin: the challenge of categorizing, quantifying, and structuring your humanities data; and the difficulty of defining visualization solution(s) that make it usefully accessible.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>On the definition of dates, I was really excited to be introduced to Bruce Robertson’s <a href="http://heml.mta.ca/heml-cocoon/">Historical Event Markup Language</a></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>We also started to lay out the tough choices one must make that will restrict what your visualization offers, but which will allow you to actually create it.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The notes have lots of links, but two other interesting examples I hadn’t yet explored are <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/group/spatialhistory/cgi-bin/site/gallery.php">Stanford’s Spatial History Project Gallery</a> and Richmond’s <a href="http://dsl.richmond.edu/emancipation/">“Visualizing Emancipation”</a>.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During lunch, I met up with two instructional technologists from my brother’s Gettysburg College (and James, you should know that they are died-in-the-wool <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ffdt0Zw1BG8">Shots in the Dark</a> fans). One of them, Sharon Birch, made <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/jq39aglfp29erub/Retro.pdf">this brilliant comic</a> of the first day!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After lunch I poked in to Jeffrey McClurken’s workshop on teaching digital history (he provided a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GNbwozFt--ab_RyReU7WumOtSZuNmYhUazhSljIk8RQ/edit#heading=h.o29zpwsm8wx">great list of links</a> encapsulating most of the subject)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I soon switched to a panel on new horizons in humanities publishing, in which I heard for the first time a debate over whether Twitter should count as a scholarly production. I am glad that this notion was <a href="https://twitter.com/savasavasava/status/343087808719749121">strongly rebuffed</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At this point <a href="https://twitter.com/matthewdlincoln/status/343063910745788417">I started pining</a> for other art historians, as I often find myself doing in these kinds of multi-disciplinary events. Luckily I found <a href="http://chnm2013.thatcamp.org/author/eblake/">at least one</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I had to check out a bit early to get back to DC for other engagements, but now I’m just ready to get as much sleep as possible before trucking all the way back out to Fairfax for more tomorrow. Stay tuned.</p>

	<p>Tim Sherratt’s <a href="http://wraggelabs.com/shed/presentations/digisam/#/text">keynote address to the Digisam conference</a> on Open Heritage Data in the Nordic Region (entitled “A map and some pins”) is helping me cope with some of my own frustratingly messy data:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One of the things I love about being a historian is that the more we focus in on the past the more complicated it gets. People don’t always do what we expect them to, and that’s both infuriating and wonderful.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Likewise, while we often have to clean up or “normalise” cultural heritage data in order to do things with it, we should value its intrinsic messiness as a reminder that it is shot through with history. Invested with the complexities of human experience it resists our attempts at reduction, and that too is both infuriating and wonderful.</p>

<p>The glories of messiness challenge the extractive metaphors that often characterise our use of digital data. We’re not merely digging or mining or drilling for oil, because each journey into the data offers new possibilities – our horizons are opened, because our categories refuse to be closed. These are journeys of enrichment, interpretation and creation, not extraction.</p>

  <p>Honthorst, the successful court painter in The Hague, had, while he still flourished as an artist, a lively brush; but, whether it was to please the girls, or because money lulled him to sleep, he fell into a stiff smoothness: about which Linschoten, who was used to attacking his work lustily, taunted him, saying that Honthorst could no longer do a worthwhile stroke. “All the same,” replied the latter, “I do better strokes than you every day of the week, and I’ll show you one you can’t repeat.” So saying, he pulled a handful of ducats from his purse, shoved them on the table, and stroked them towards him, by which he meant to show that with his painting, however it might look, he knew how to earn money, whereas Linschoten, with his broad brush, was still a poor man.</p>

<p>One of my favorite quotes from Samuel van Hoogstraten’s 1678 <em>Inleyding tot de hooge schoole der schilderkonst</em>, translation by Paul Taylor in <em>Dutch Flower Painting 1600-1720</em> (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1995)</p>

	<p>A recent graduate of our department is exploring digital dissemination of the core discovery in his dissertation. The thought process that led him to this discovery is uniquely well-suited to a digital visualization (<a href="http://matthewlincoln.net/2013/05/22/aesthetic-provocations.html">a hobby-horse of mine</a>) hosted on a personal website. He is torn, however, between the imperative to market his own work and the fear of “cheapening” his scholarship through digital publication, as well as the not-totally-unjustified fear of theft.</p>

<p>Newly-minted humanities Ph.Ds in the paranoiac job market may be right to fear resistance or disbelief of more retardataire senior scholars. But I’d argue a good number of those same scholars can be convinced of the available grant opportunities, not to mention the wide open research possibilities in digital art history, and the benefits of open-access distribution of scholarly work.</p>

<p>Ross Mounce recently posted a cogent argument for <a href="http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2013/05/24/easy-steps-towards-open-scholarship/">uploading preprints of scholarship before they are accepted for publishing</a>, arguing that overcoming this cultural and psychological barrier results in your work being read and cited more. (hat tip: <a href="http://digitalhumanitiesnow.org/">Digital Humanities Now</a>) Ross notes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I suspect, like in biology, this practice isn’t yet mainstream in the Arts &amp; Humanities – perhaps just a matter of time before this cultural shift occurs… There is one important caveat to mention with respect to posting preprints – a small minority of conservative, traditional journals will not accept articles that have been posted online prior to submission.</p>

<p>According to according to the <a href="http://www.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo/issn/0004-3079/">SHERPA/ROMEo survey</a>, the <a href="http://www.collegeart.org/artbulletin/">Art Bulletin</a> doesn’t formally support the archiving of pre- or post-print PDFs of articles. But a better entry point for digital scholarship may be nascent open-access, online-only, peer-reviewed journals like the <a href="http://www.jhna.org/index.php/about-jhna/mission-statement">Journal of the Historians of Netherlandish Art</a>. I am curious if open-access humanities journals will, in these early days, trend towards specialized fields of study staked out by already-established scholarly societies, as these societies can bring their ready-made social network of peer-reviewers. The JHNA’s online platform is incredibly basic, but its articles have been a solid mix of both new and established scholars (in other words, they seem to have broken out of the <a href="http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUL.InstRepos:4322577">vicious cycle of prestige-chasing</a>). Their organizational commitment having already been made, I look forward to seeing the journal jump some more technical barriers next, such as adopting some good born-digital scholarship tools like <a href="http://www.futureofthebook.org/commentpress/">Comment Press</a>.</p>

<p>Scholars can also just circumvent this whole process and directly post their work online, critics be damned. If you are interested in getting your work in front of eyeballs, <a href="http://abramfox.com/caa-2013/">Abram Fox</a> notes the online audience for <a href="http://abramfox.com/cv/caa-2013/">one of his papers</a> quickly exceeded the in-person audience at its national conference presentation.</p>

<p><strong>In the same vein, I’ve just uploaded three of my projects on here: a more traditional scholarly paper on <a href="http://matthewlincoln.net/projects/patriotic-and-religious-geographies-in-emanuel-de-wittes-church-paintings.html">Emanuel de Witte</a>, and two digital humanities projects on <a href="http://matthewlincoln.net/projects/albrecht-durer-in-google-earth.html">mapping an artist’s diary</a>, and getting Google Earth to <a href="http://matthewlincoln.net/projects/timespan-elements-in-kml.html">recognize pre-eighteenth-century dates</a>.</strong></p>

<div class="content">
	<p>After my experience with the unstructured un-conference model last weekend, I was interested to read Adam Richardson’s thoughts on <a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2013/06/boosting_creativity_through_co.html">constraints and creativity</a> in Harvard Business Review. I liked this analogy:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In Silicon Valley start-ups a common philosophy these days is “mobile first”: create the mobile app or mobile version of the web site before you do the “full” version. Partly this is driven by the fact that many of these start-ups’ customers will be accessing the new service primarily through a mobile device, and may never look at the web site on a desktop browser. But a side benefit is that a phone’s small screen forces discipline about what’s really critical to communicate to the customer, and which functionality customers will really need.</p>

	<p>The “flipped” or “inverted” classroom is a hot trend in higher-ed (<a href="http://chronicle.com/search/?search_siteId=5&amp;contextId=&amp;action=rem&amp;searchQueryString=flipped">peruse the <em>Chronicle</em>’s archives</a> to get an idea.) In brief, the instructor in a flipped classroom channels most of their content delivery (lectures, readings) <em>outisde</em> the classroom, often through screencasts students can watch on their own time. This frees up time in the classroom for critical discussion, questions, and student collaboration, thus taking advantage of the best part of a traditional classroom: having bodies in the room! (Or <a href="http://archives.williams.edu/williamshistory/greylock/mhopkins.php">seated on ends of a log</a>, if, like me, you prefer a Williams College analogy.)</p>

<p>The Michelle Smith Collaboratory has been developing resources to help our faculty and teaching assistants transition to this new format. We like to say we’re “rotating the classroom”, helping to ease our instructors gradually into a more completely  flipped course.</p>

<p>One of my favorite tools made this spring is a series of short videos written by <a href="http://arthistory.umd.edu/graduate-students/Molly%20Harrington">Molly Harrington</a> and edited by <a href="http://arthistory.umd.edu/graduate-students/Madeline%20Gent">Madeline Gent</a> that verbally explain and visually illustrate core concepts of formal analysis in art history. Assign this series as homework for your students, so the next week you can spend the whole time evaluating and honing their skills, rather than spending class time on initial definitions.</p>

	<p>In a recent <a href="http://sixdegreesoffrancisbacon.com/post/53595757782/networks-as-constructs-the-curious-case-of-margaret">guest post</a> on the Six Degrees of Francis Bacon project, Shawn Moore discusses the curious networks of Maria Cavendish. Moore writes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In many ways, her networks are non-traditional in that they often exist outside of and beyond Cavendish herself…</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of significant interest is that the DNB data shows how important extra-personal (looking for a word that indicates connections beyond the intra-personal) connections are for the network Cavendish constructs, and to the networks that are constructed around the reception and reputation of “Margaret Cavendish,” thus exposing an important structure in the sociable practices at play during the period.</p>

<p>In other words, it seems that understanding the reception of a figure’s work through network graphs requires surveying more than the immediate neighborhood, or ego network, of figures just one edge away from Margaret Cavendish (or Rembrandt van Rijn, for that matter.) It is, of course, the relationships between these first, second, or third-level nodes that actually constitute the public conversation about the root author or artist, the conversation we are so eager to better understand.</p>

<p>It was after I dove into Gephi last week that I found Scott Weingart’s excellent <a href="http://journalofdigitalhumanities.org/1-1/demystifying-networks-by-scott-weingart/">overview of network analysis for humanitsts</a>.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> After a cogent introduction to the basics, Weingart offers some pointed warnings to humanists about creating multimodal networks - that is, networks with different classes of nodes (e.g. artists and organizations, illustrated below.) These require their own analytical and layout tools.</p>

<p>Although for my own purposes I am content to filter out organizations from the ULAN dataset, I also want to take advantage of the rich variations of relationships it describes. This means devising some scheme for weighting relationship types by their attribute (“master of” assigned a weight of 10, for example, while “collaborator with” gets a weight of 5).<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>One would have to customize such a scheme depending on what type of influence you were interested in visualizing; interpretation and all its accompanying biases will be layered on fast and thick. I predict this will be one of the biggest hurdles to overcome as we move forward with this project.</p>

<p class="author">

</p>
<div class="content">
	<p>These past few weeks I have been sorting through the data available in the Getty’s <a href="http://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/ulan/about.html">Union List of Artist Names</a>, learning how to parse its raw XML and create tables of relevant data.</p>

<p>I was initially interested in the ULAN for its geographic information, hoping to use it in visualizing on a large scale the evolving connections between Netherlandish artists and the broader European, and global, community in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. However, I was largely disappointed by the ULAN’s sparse geographic and chronological information. Most artists have only one, maybe two entries for their active locations; for example, poor Peter Paul Rubens, a continent-skipping artist, courtier, and diplomat/spy, is <a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/ULANFullDisplay?find=rubens&amp;role=&amp;nation=&amp;prev_page=1&amp;subjectid=500002921">attached only to Antwerp</a>.</p>

<p>The ULAN does, however, richly characterize artistic, professional, and familial relationships between its many entries. After meeting with <a href="http://abramfox.com/">Abram</a> this week to learn more about his social network map of <a href="http://abramfox.com/cv/caa-2013/">Benjamin West’s studio</a> generated using <a href="https://www.gephi.org/">Gephi</a>, I was inspired to try the program out on a “small” sample of the ULAN database <a href="http://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/obtain/download.html">made available for download</a> by the Getty.</p>

<p><a href="http://mlincoln.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/screen-shot-2013-06-20-at-1-49-53-pm.png"><img src="http://mlincoln.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/screen-shot-2013-06-20-at-1-49-53-pm.png" alt="A force-directed graph generated from the association fields contained in a small sample of the Getty's ULAN (visualization by Matthew Lincoln, underlying data © 2013 The J. Paul Getty Trust. All rights reserved.)" title="A force-directed graph generated from the association fields contained in a small sample of the Getty's ULAN (visualization by Matthew Lincoln, underlying data © 2013 The J. Paul Getty Trust. All rights reserved.)" /></a></p>

<p>There’s no denying that this nicely-styled network graph is pretty. But is it useful?</p>

<p>In the above graph, nodes are scaled by their degree (how many immediate connections they have to other nodes) and colored by their eigenvector centrality (a measure of their relative centrality to the network at large)<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> Though the array of artists in the sample data is idiosyncratic (from Raphael to Hans Hoffman), it isn’t surprising to see big names like Jacques-Louis David appear, well, <em>big</em> due to their well-connectedness.</p>

<p>However looking at color in this graph is a bit more interesting. A node (like David) important to its immediate social neighborhood does not necessarily connect as many disparate groups as a node (like David’s close neighbor Jean-Baptiste Regnault) with greater eigenvector centrality.</p>

<p>What does this measure tell us about artists like Regnault? How should it inform the way we define and value relationships when thinking about art historical problems? The ULAN has a comprehensive vocabulary of association types, from professional associations like “teacher of” or “apprentice of”, to familial ones like “spouse of” or “child of”. On the scale of micro-art-history, we treat these relationships individually, valuing relationships sure to communicate stylistic influence over others. At this scale, our weighting can happen on a case-by-case basis; we can generate our narratives holistically.</p>

<p>But when trying to measure influence from a distant perspective, looking at dozens or hundreds of artists at the same time (something uniquely suited to a digital approach), we cannot make decisions case-by-case. We must instead define rules. These may be finely-tuned filters, but nonetheless they call on us to make generalizations. When I graphed the sample ULAN data, I established a filter that would only show artistic relationships, and would cut out familial ones.</p>

<p><a href="http://mlincoln.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/screen-shot-2013-06-20-at-1-50-34-pm.png"><img src="http://mlincoln.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/screen-shot-2013-06-20-at-1-50-34-pm.png?w=625" alt="A graph of Rembrandt's social network, including only artistic relationships.

(visualization by Matthew Lincoln, underlying data © 2013 The J. Paul Getty Trust. All rights reserved.)" /></a></p>

<p>The corner of my graph showing Rembrandt reacted notably when I redrew the graph incorporating every type of relationship. Suddenly, Rembrandt was not only a central connector of individuals, but a connector of distinct communities that would otherwise not be attached.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p><a href="http://mlincoln.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/screen-shot-2013-06-20-at-1-49-10-pm.png"><img src="http://mlincoln.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/screen-shot-2013-06-20-at-1-49-10-pm.png?w=625" alt="A graph of Rembrandt's social network, including artistic, professional, and familial relationships.

All rights reserved.)" title="A graph of Rembrandt's social network, including artistic, professional, and familial relationships. (visualization by Matthew Lincoln, underlying data © 2013 The J. Paul Getty Trust. All rights reserved.)" /></a></p>

<p>Much of this change is caused by the addition of several more nodes when I allowed Gephi to graph the full range of relationships described by the ULAN. However, note that non-artistic interconnections also appeared between nodes that had no other connections besides Rembrandt in the first iteration of my graph. In cleaning my data, I inadvertently undervalued nodes like Rembrandt that actually connected integrated communities, not just disparate individuals.</p>

<p>I initially thought to myself that this visualization and analysis would require a lot of preparatory planning to establish correct filtering and weighting rules. But distant looking might rather demand that the researcher iterate several visualizations, not to approach some platonic ideal visualization, but instead to generate layers to be superimposed and stitched together in a convincing narrative, <a href="http://matthewlincoln.net/2013/06/19/open-data-and-the-humanities.html">much like Tim Sherratt suggested</a>. In other words, I now wonder if this process of distant looking might have its own kind of holistic process distinct from, yet related to the close looking model.</p>

<p>The practice of distant looking at historical networks will need to establish its own critical methods as digital humanities fields mature (look to the folks behind <a href="http://sixdegreesoffrancisbacon.com/">Six Degrees of Francis Bacon</a> for some deep posts on this topic.) Again and again, I think we will find that the processes of the digital humanities have much in common with the alternately-maligned-and-enshrined traditional methodologies.</p>

	<p>Tim Sherratt’s <a href="http://wraggelabs.com/shed/presentations/digisam/#/text">keynote address to the Digisam conference</a> on Open Heritage Data in the Nordic Region (entitled “A map and some pins”) is helping me cope with some of my own frustratingly messy data:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One of the things I love about being a historian is that the more we focus in on the past the more complicated it gets. People don’t always do what we expect them to, and that’s both infuriating and wonderful.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Likewise, while we often have to clean up or “normalise” cultural heritage data in order to do things with it, we should value its intrinsic messiness as a reminder that it is shot through with history. Invested with the complexities of human experience it resists our attempts at reduction, and that too is both infuriating and wonderful.</p>

<p>The glories of messiness challenge the extractive metaphors that often characterise our use of digital data. We’re not merely digging or mining or drilling for oil, because each journey into the data offers new possibilities – our horizons are opened, because our categories refuse to be closed. These are journeys of enrichment, interpretation and creation, not extraction.</p>

  <p>Honthorst, the successful court painter in The Hague, had, while he still flourished as an artist, a lively brush; but, whether it was to please the girls, or because money lulled him to sleep, he fell into a stiff smoothness: about which Linschoten, who was used to attacking his work lustily, taunted him, saying that Honthorst could no longer do a worthwhile stroke. “All the same,” replied the latter, “I do better strokes than you every day of the week, and I’ll show you one you can’t repeat.” So saying, he pulled a handful of ducats from his purse, shoved them on the table, and stroked them towards him, by which he meant to show that with his painting, however it might look, he knew how to earn money, whereas Linschoten, with his broad brush, was still a poor man.</p>

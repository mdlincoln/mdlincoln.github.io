	<p><a href="http://matthewlincoln.net/2013/08/08/scraping-the-smithsonian.html">Yesterday I posted</a> about a Ruby script I published for scraping information from <a href="http://collections.si.edu">collections.si.edu</a>. Today I <a href="https://github.com/mdlincoln/si-scrape">pushed a sister script , <code>si-parse.rb</code></a>, that will turn <code>si-scrape.rb</code>’s raw HTML output into well-formed JSON.</p>

<p>I’d initially wanted to try and make this tool as friendly to tech-uncomfortable humanities scholars as possible, and have it spit out a CSV that could be opened and manipulated in Excel. However, to do that would not just mean flattening the Smithsonian data, but squashing it completely. Even a carefully-limited query on <a href="http://collections.si.edu">collections.si.edu</a> could return you a list containing paintings side by side with airplane models, oral history transcripts, articles of clothing, photographs, and library catalog records. A two-dimensional table would have hundreds of thousands of unused cells, as rows describing paintings would have to leave room for video duration tags, call numbers, or industrial manufacturer descriptions required by other objects.</p>

<p>Rather than try to anticipate multiple cases of desired functionality, and thus potentially limit the tool’s <em>actual</em> functionality, I elected to dump everything into the flexible <a href="http://json.org">JSON format</a>, which can reliably describe objects with heterogeneous metadata, and comes standard with the ability to handle data fields with multiple values (such as a “topic” field with multiple assigned keywords). I’m already trying out all kinds of ways to search and interpret this data, and it works like a charm.</p>

<p>But what average scholar in the humanities would know what to do with this output?</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/computer.gif" alt="computer confusion" /></p>

<p>I was reminded of a minor debate that came up during a session from this June’s THATCamp Prime on scripting languages (<a href="http://chnm2013.thatcamp.org/notepads/scripting-for-humanists/">notes available here</a>) proposed by <a href="http://lincolnmullen.com/blog/report-from-thatcamp/">Lincoln Mullen</a>. There was some back and forth about whether or not the most tech-savy in the DH sphere ought to work harder to make easy to use interfaces for their tools, or whether it is instead better to ask scholars interested in digital approaches to roll up their sleeves and get (at least somewhat) familiar with computing details.</p>

<p>At first I felt the former attitude was the more productive one. If we are to spread digital humanities practices through the academy, shouldn’t we strive to make our tools as accessible as possible? Yet a counter-argument was raised that, just as many programs require their students gain competency in applicable foreign languages, shouldn’t it be acceptable to ask a budding digital humanist to learn applicable coding languages?</p>

<p>Humanities scholars are (rightly) fond of saying that they embrace complex arguments that can’t be boiled down to a bumper sticker or a bullet point. Perhaps they will increasingly come to embrace not only vital complexity in digital methodologies, but also their own capacity to learn these tools and bend them to their own needs. Some fantastic resources, like Jason Heppler’s <a href="http://jasonheppler.org/rubyist-historian/">Rubyist Historian</a>, are already helping to bridge this knowledge gap. I anticipate (hope?) that as more and more DH projects filter into traditional venues like the MLA or CAA conferences, we will see not only a rise in <em>acceptance</em> of these projects as legitimate academic production, but also a rise in the <em>literacies</em> needed to both create and critique them.</p>

<div class="content">
	<p>I’m proud to push one of my first real forays into digital humanities toolmaking to GitHub today: <a href="https://github.com/mdlincoln/si-scrape">si-scrape</a>, a Ruby script that scrapes data off of the Smithsonian Institution’s collection web portal <a href="http://collections.si.edu">collections.si.edu</a>.</p>

<p>It’s a quick and dirty implementation at the moment (one that will be happily outdated once the Smithsonian finishes deploying a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_data">Linked Open Data</a> interface!) but it could hopefully serve as a model for web-scraping other institutions whose public-facing collection websites are at least partially machine-readable.</p>

<p>All you need to run it is the URL that <a href="http://collections.si.edu">collections.si.edu</a> generates once you define a search query. For example, searching for objects of the type <code>Works of Art</code> that feature the keyword <code>"space"</code> generates this URL: </p>

<pre><code>http://collections.si.edu/search/results.htm?tag.cstype=all&amp;q=space&amp;fq=object_type:%22Works+of+art%22
</code></pre>

<p>Plug this URL into <code>si-scrape.rb</code> and it will deliver a ~50 MB HTML file that concatenates all the returned records that <a href="http://collections.si.edu">collections.si.edu</a> normally paginates over hundreds of pages. You can then further parse this HTML to pull out the desired data. The Smithsonian has done rather well with this web interface; almost all of the metadata fields for a given object have been nicely tagged in the HTML so that you can easily have the computer hunt down <code>date</code>, <code>title</code>, or <code>topic</code> classes.</p>

<p>I intend to make future versions of this script that will output a flat CSV that one can open and manipulate in Excel, making this script more accessible to the broader humanities community that doesn’t care to fumble with Ruby and <a href="http://nokogiri.org">Nokogiri</a>. Such an implementation would need to be flexible enough to accept the huge range of metadata fields that the Smithsonian’s expansive and diverse collections demand. More experienced Ruby wranglers are <a href="https://github.com/mdlincoln/si-scrape">welcome to contribute</a>!</p>

<p>I’m already using this script to do some bulk processing of the keyword schemae in the Smithsonian art collections. In a future post I’ll be talking a bit more in depth about that, but for now here is a pretty teaser of a topic co-occurrence map of the Smithsonian American Art Museum’s painting collection, all of it collected using <code>si-scrape.rb</code>:</p>

Paul Getty Museum, MS. 20, FOL. 83. Image © 2013, The J. Paul Getty Trust. All rights reserved." /></a></p>

<p>The <em>Mira calligraphiae monumenta</em> is one of the most intriguing objects of the <em>kusntkammer</em> of Rudolf II. The creators of this layered work never met each other; Georg Bocskay, secretary for Ferdinand I, penned the manuscript’s calligraphic displays in 1561-2, while Joris Hoefnagel was commissioned by Rudolf three decades later to illuminate this treasure with brilliantly rendered flora and fauna. </p>

<p>It has been argued that Hoefnagel’s additions establish a <em>paragone</em> between the painted image and the written word, his illusionistic <em>naturalia</em> surpassing Bocskay’s page-bound <em>artificialia</em>. It has been further argued that the outcome of this <em>paragone</em> reflects a Paracelsian philosophy shared by the Rudolfine court: that true knowledge can only come from natural investigation and not from secondary texts. However, this interpretation elides the complexities of magical and occult studies in Prague. The diverse schools of occult thought entertained at the Rudolfine court also included that of Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa, who believed inscribed signs had the capacity to become sigils endowed with power over the natural world. </p>

<p>I argue that the complex formal interplay of text and image on certain pages of the <em>MCM</em> at times suggests that Bocskay’s scripts indeed hold sway over Hoefnagel’s natural objects. This suggests that even as Rudolf and his court appreciated the <em>MCM</em> for its aesthetic beauty and inventiveness, these semiotically-intelligent readers must also have related its formally-cohesive tableaus of text and nature to sixteenth-century occult notions of the physical power of the inscribed sign investigated in their own court.</p>

<div class="content">
	<p>Andrew Keener <a href="http://andrewkeener.wordpress.com/2013/07/31/jacob-burckhardt-and-the-crisis-in-renaissance-humanities/">smartly notes</a> that Jacob Burckhardt described a kind of “crisis in the humanities” that took place in the sixteenth century. In Burckhardt’s 1860 <em>Die Kultur der Renaissance in Italien</em>, we read about the rise of scholarly acrimony:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Of all men who ever formed a class, they had the last sense of their common interests…. All means were held lawful, if one of them saw a change of supplanting another. From literary discussion they passed with astonishing suddenness to the fiercest and most groundless vituperation. Not satisfied with refuting, they sought to annihilate an opponent. (272-73)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Keener sees parallels to the current humanities crisis rhetoric:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I want to emphasize that Burckhardt’s account, composed during the mid-nineteenth century, delivers a picture of sixteenth-century Europe in which the humanist struggled to get by. The wide availability of printed books rendered his lectures and expertise less relevant or necessary. He faced opposition from the public, and was scorned as self-indulgent, extravagant, and atheistic. However, he also attacked and was attacked by other humanists in a heated race for influence and glory. Wandering up and down the country in search of stable income, the humanist ultimately found it difficult to settle in one place, and found himself disconnected from the public, which “demanded something new.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The <em>Mira calligraphiae monumenta</em> is one of the most intriguing objects of the <em>kusntkammer</em> of Rudolf II. The creators of this layered work never met each other; Georg Bocskay, secretary for Ferdinand I, penned the manuscript’s calligraphic displays in 1561-2, while Joris Hoefnagel was commissioned by Rudolf three decades later to illuminate this treasure with brilliantly rendered flora and fauna. </p>

<p>It has been argued that Hoefnagel’s additions establish a <em>paragone</em> between the painted image and the written word, his illusionistic <em>naturalia</em> surpassing Bocskay’s page-bound <em>artificialia</em>. It has been further argued that the outcome of this <em>paragone</em> reflects a Paracelsian philosophy shared by the Rudolfine court: that true knowledge can only come from natural investigation and not from secondary texts. However, this interpretation elides the complexities of magical and occult studies in Prague. The diverse schools of occult thought entertained at the Rudolfine court also included that of Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa, who believed inscribed signs had the capacity to become sigils endowed with power over the natural world. </p>

<p>I argue that the complex formal interplay of text and image on certain pages of the <em>MCM</em> at times suggests that Bocskay’s scripts indeed hold sway over Hoefnagel’s natural objects. This suggests that even as Rudolf and his court appreciated the <em>MCM</em> for its aesthetic beauty and inventiveness, these semiotically-intelligent readers must also have related its formally-cohesive tableaus of text and nature to sixteenth-century occult notions of the physical power of the inscribed sign investigated in their own court.</p>

<p class="author">

<div class="content">
	<p>Andrew Keener <a href="http://andrewkeener.wordpress.com/2013/07/31/jacob-burckhardt-and-the-crisis-in-renaissance-humanities/">smartly notes</a> that Jacob Burckhardt described a kind of “crisis in the humanities” that took place in the sixteenth century. In Burckhardt’s 1860 <em>Die Kultur der Renaissance in Italien</em>, we read about the rise of scholarly acrimony:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Of all men who ever formed a class, they had the last sense of their common interests…. All means were held lawful, if one of them saw a change of supplanting another. From literary discussion they passed with astonishing suddenness to the fiercest and most groundless vituperation. Not satisfied with refuting, they sought to annihilate an opponent. (272-73)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Keener sees parallels to the current humanities crisis rhetoric:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I want to emphasize that Burckhardt’s account, composed during the mid-nineteenth century, delivers a picture of sixteenth-century Europe in which the humanist struggled to get by. The wide availability of printed books rendered his lectures and expertise less relevant or necessary. He faced opposition from the public, and was scorned as self-indulgent, extravagant, and atheistic. However, he also attacked and was attacked by other humanists in a heated race for influence and glory. Wandering up and down the country in search of stable income, the humanist ultimately found it difficult to settle in one place, and found himself disconnected from the public, which “demanded something new.”</p>

<p class="author">

</p>
<div class="content">
	<p>Something interesting that cropped up while I was on vacation last week. The design agency <a href="http://accurat.it">Accurat</a> (which has developed several other novel visualizations of cultural texts and histories) has created intriguing infographics <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/accurat/sets/72157633953437972/with/8961090343/">visualizing ten modern painters’ lives</a>. (hat tip: <a href="http://hyperallergic.com/76259/10-painters-lives-chronicled-as-infographics/">hyperallergic</a> via the <a href="https://twitter.com/MSCollaboratory/status/360456068507250688">MSCVC</a>)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/accurat/8961090259/"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3806/8961090259_ba40cf018d_c.jpg" alt="Visualising Painters' Lives by accurat.it, on Flickr" title="Visualising Painters' Lives by accurat.it, on Flickr" /></a></p>

<p>They have structured the infographics as multi-layered timelines marked with single-point events, spans of time indicating things such as a career in a studio or academy, or a romantic or professional relationship. Affixed to these representations of the artist’s life are timelines of their work signposted with landmark paintings, sigils rendered in the color schemes observed at that phase in the painter’s career, and histograms that claim to mark out that artist’s participation in a certain artistic school or movement. The iconography is delightfully idiosyncratic, shaped to resemble motifs that have come to be associated with each of the ten artists.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/images/matisselegend.png"><img src="/assets/images/matisselegend.png" alt="Detail from Henri Matisse" title="Detail of the histogram legend from the Matisse infographic. By accurat.it" /></a></p>

<p>I’m particularly interested in the histograms charting artwork style, size, and palette. Accurat did a particularly admirable job visualizing the many schools and movements interweaved through each artist’s oeuvre: color-coded words are clustered and stacked near concentrations of paintings that exhibit a certain style, e.g. expressionism or cubism. But because bars on the histogram are keyed to these colors, it is also possible to clearly indicate one instance of late cubism in Matisse’s oeuvre, while still legibly showing that most of his experimentation with that style happened earlier in his life.</p>

<p>Some errant thoughts on the project:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>While Accurat points out these graphs are by no means comprehensive or “scientific”, they mention that they drew data from open online databases like Wikipedia, so I wonder to what extent they automated this process.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Could one do something similar with data culled from <a href="http://artstor.org">ARTstor</a>, which has very solid date and repository information, or <a href="http://artsy.net/">artsy</a>, which has tagged a wealth of works with more squishy metadata like color and movement?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A histogram of different styles works quite well for the exhaustively-taxonimized twentieth century, but I suspect this might not be quite as illuminating for earlier periods that haven’t been dissected into named stylistic movements. Maybe it would be productive to make a histogram of genres (portraits, landscapes, altarpieces) or sizes and compositional schemes.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

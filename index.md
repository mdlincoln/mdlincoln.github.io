I am a Ph.D. student in Art History at the [University of Maryland, College Park](http://arthistory.umd.edu/graduate-students/Matthew%20Lincoln).
I focus on sixteenth- and seventeenth-century northern European art, with a particular concentration in digital research and analysis techniques.
I am interested in the potential for computer-aided analysis of cultural datasets to help model long-term artistic trends in iconography, art markets, and social relations between artists in the early modern period.
As a Graduate Assistant in the Digital Humanities in the [Michelle Smith Collaboratory for Visual Culture](http://michellesmithcollaboratory.umd.edu/), I explored innovative methods for processing and visualizing structured art historical data sources generated by libraries and museums.
My current research employs computational social network analysis to help understand the long-term changes in the relationships between print designers, engravers, and publishers in the Netherlands between 1500--1800.

On this site you can find my [contact info and CV](/about), various [blog posts](/archive) on art history, digital humanities, and (occasionally) the [Super Mutant Ninja Turtles](/2013/09/10/ninja-turtles.html), and the full-text of conference talks and descriptions of my digital projects on the ['Projects' page](/projects).

I am a Ph.D. student studying sixteenth and seventeenth-century northern European art at the [University of Maryland, College Park](http://arthistory.umd.edu/graduate-students/Matthew%20Lincoln), with a particular focus on Netherlandish mannerism, early modern courtly collecting, and print culture.
I am also interested in developing innovative digital methods for art historical research, including computer-assisted visualization and analysis of artistic social networks and long-term artistic trends.
I've served as a Graduate Assistant in the Digital Humanities in the [Michelle Smith Collaboratory for Visual Culture](http://michellesmithcollaboratory.umd.edu/), exploring innovative methods for processing and visualizing structured art historical data sources generated by libraries and museums.

On this site you can find my [contact info and CV](/about), various [blog posts](/archive) on art history, digital humanities, and (occasionally) the [Super Mutant Ninja Turtles](/2013/09/10/ninja-turtles.html), and the full-text of conference talks and descriptions of my digital projects on the ['Projects' page](/projects).

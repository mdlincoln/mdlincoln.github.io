<div class="content">
	<p>The Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media at George Mason University in Fairfax, VA is hosting <a href="http://chnm2013.thatcamp.org/">2013 THATCamp PRIME</a> on June 7-8, 2013. They label themselves an “un-conference”, maybe best explained in their own words:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>An unconference is to a conference what a seminar is to a lecture, what a party at your house is to a church wedding, what a pick-up game of Ultimate Frisbee is to an NBA game, what a jam band is to a symphony orchestra: it’s more informal and more participatory. To get the most out of THATCamp, have fun, be productive, and stay collegial. Don’t bring a presentation (unless you’re teaching a workshop). Propose a session and take charge of running it. Talk, make, teach, play. Listen.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Some of the sessions (or is workshop a better term?) already proposed include “<a href="http://chnm2013.thatcamp.org/05/01/synchronicity-powerpoint-unhinged/">powerpoint-cum-MadLibs</a>” (which reads to me like some hellish version of our comprehensive exams) and a more traditional-sounding <a href="http://chnm2013.thatcamp.org/05/02/de-moocing-the-past/">conversation about MOOCs</a>.</p>

	<p>An article on <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/04/books/budget-cuts-hobble-library-of-congress.html?_r=0">sequestration’s impact on the Library of Congress</a> is a good reminder of the importance of archiving the seemingly-trivial.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Often the library will have one of the few remaining or sole copies of something that seemed insignificant when it was registered but becomes important with the flow of time. For example, President Obama’s father wrote a book in the 1960s in Luo, his tribal dialect, to promote adult literacy in Kenya. It was stored and cataloged with little interest after it was contributed by the library’s field office in Nairobi; today it is one of only four known copies.</p>

	<p><a href="http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/literally-psyched/2013/04/12/why-grad-schools-should-require-students-to-blog/">Maria Konnikova’s </a> <a href="http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/literally-psyched/2013/04/12/why-grad-schools-should-require-students-to-blog/"><em>Scientific American</em></a> post (hat tip to <a href="http://twitter.com/abramfox">Abram Fox</a>) on blogging in graduate school got me thinking.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Academia as a whole is still quite skeptical of popular writing and anything that takes time from <em>serious</em> academic pursuits. These include reading articles in your discipline, reading publications and books by your field leaders and co-workers, working on writing up your own studies for publication (the more and the faster, the better), and networking and presenting your work at academic conferences. Having a blog? Freelancing on the side? Working on pieces for the non-academic, a.k.a, popular, press? Not very high on the list. In fact, in direct opposition to the list, as each of these pursuits takes time away from what you <em>should</em> be doing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Konnikova doesn’t even touch the big issue that I think continually hampers academic work, particularly in the humanities: deeply insular research and writing in which projects are reserved (even concealed!) until they are %110 ready for publication. Of course, this preemptively shuts off the discussion and collaboration we spend so much time praising in symposia and grant applications.</p>

<p>I’m relaunching this site in an effort to chronicle some of the less traditional projects I’m working on at the Department of Art History &amp; Archaeology at the University of Maryland. I certainly hope to connect to other scholars interested in incorporating technology into their research and teaching (and please, <a href="http://matthewlincoln.net/about">connect away</a>.) My other hope, however, is to burnish the kind of clear writing ability that Konnikova exercises through blogging, a kind of writing that necessarily forces one to think more clearly as well.</p>

<p>So, watch this space.</p>

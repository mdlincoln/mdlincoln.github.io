# Interests


Matthew Lincoln is a Ph.D. student studying sixteenth and seventeenth-century northern European art under Dr. Arthur Wheelock, with a particular interest in Dutch mannerism, print culture, and early modern word/image relations. Ongoing projects include incorporating technology into humanities research, including geographic and social network visualizations, and generating interactive tools for exploring primary source texts in art history.

In the spring of 2012 he defended his MA thesis, ["Hendrick Goltzius' Protean Iconography: 1582-1590"](http://drum.lib.umd.edu//handle/1903/12861), which investigated the novel and erudite iconographies invented by the famed Dutch engraver during the crucial early years of his career. This year Matthew has been preparing a section of this thesis for publication while continuing to progress through his Ph.D. coursework. In October he will also be presenting research on the sixteenth-century painter Joris Hoefnagel at the [2013 Sixteenth Century Society Conference](http://sixteenthcentury.org/conference/). In addition to this research, Matthew served as a Graduate Assistant in the Digital Humanities in the [Michelle Smith Collaboratory for Visual Culture](http://michellesmithcollaboratory.umd.edu/) in spring 2013. Tasked with exploring ways to incorporate digital technology into art historical teaching, research, and publishing, Matthew developed prototypes for two projects that may serve as models for future scholarship: an interactive map automatically generated from the diary of Albrecht Dürer’s trip to the Netherlands in 1520, and a visual database of early modern artist’s movements that he will continue to develop with the Collaboratory over summer 2013.

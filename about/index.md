# Interests


Matthew Lincoln is a Ph.D. student studying sixteenth and seventeenth-century northern European art under Dr. Arthur Wheelock, with a particular interest in Dutch mannerism, print culture, and early modern word/image relations. Ongoing projects include incorporating technology into humanities research, with an emphasis on visualizing and analyzing artistic social networks, developing computer-assisted macro-scale studies of artistic trends, and exploring innovative methods for processing structured art historical data sources generated by libraries and museums.

In the spring of 2012 he defended his MA thesis, ["Hendrick Goltzius' Protean Iconography: 1582-1590"](http://drum.lib.umd.edu//handle/1903/12861), which investigated the novel and erudite iconographies invented by the famed Dutch engraver during the crucial early years of his career. This year Matthew has been preparing a section of this thesis for publication while continuing to progress through his Ph.D. coursework. 

He will also be presenting research on the sixteenth-century painter Joris Hoefnagel at the [2013 Sixteenth Century Society Conference](http://sixteenthcentury.org/conference/), participating in a workshop on digital art history at the [Smithsonian Archives of American Art](http://www.aaa.si.edu/symposium), as well as delivering a paper on automata in northern European imperial pageantry at the [2014 meeting of the Renaissance Society of America](http://www.rsa.org/?page=2014NewYork).

In addition to this research, Matthew served as a Graduate Assistant in the Digital Humanities in the [Michelle Smith Collaboratory for Visual Culture](http://michellesmithcollaboratory.umd.edu/) in spring and summer of 2013. Tasked with exploring ways to incorporate digital technology into art historical teaching, research, and publishing, Matthew developed prototypes projects that may serve as models for future scholarship: an interactive map automatically generated from the diary of Albrecht Dürer’s trip to the Netherlands in 1520; and a series of tools for visualizing structured data from library and museum collection records in order to create new perspectives on art historical trends.

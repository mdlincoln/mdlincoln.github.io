## Modelling the Network of Dutch and Flemish Print Production, 1500--1700

The wealth of Dutch and Flemish prints that survive from the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries present both a blessing and a curse for art historians.
On the one hand, this abundance has fueled vital connoisseurial research on individual printmakers and their oeuvres. This cataloging effort has given us crucial insight into one of the prime conduits for images across Europe in this period.
However, case studies alone are insufficient for understanding how changing patterns of print production may have affected trends in subject matter, style, and even the artistic and intellectual status of prints.
The sheer quantity and variety of prints from this period, and the number of individual printmakers and publishers involved, challenge traditional models of art historical argumentation.

I will address this issue by using quantitative methods to analyze large-scale changes in the organizational patterns and artistic strategies of reproductive printmakers and publishers in the Netherlands during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.
Key to my research will be the use of network analysis, a computational method for characterizing the patterns and structures that emerge from a large number of discrete ties between individuals.
Network analysis may clarify how the organization of Dutch and Flemish print production evolved after its blossoming in the mid-sixteenth century, and how individual artists participated in, and reacted to, this evolution.
While every individual designer, plate cutter, and publisher could potentially exercise a great deal of influence over the production of a single print, their individual decisions (whom to select as an engraver, what subjects to create for a print design, what market to sell to) would have been variously constrained or encouraged by their position in this larger network (Who do they already know? And who, in turn, do their contacts know?)
The collaborative process of print production, and the large databases of extant prints held in modern museum collections, makes it uniquely well-suited for a network-oriented analysis.
My dissertation will evaluate current narratives about Dutch and Flemish print production in this period, suggesting new models for thinking about its shifting organization, and help us to better explain the dialogue between artistic decisions and the material and economic demands of printmaking.

	<p>There’s been some hubub over the weekend about San Jose State University <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2013/07/19/san_jose_state_suspends_udacity_online_classes_after_students_fail_final.html">dropping its partnership with Udacity</a>, an online-learning startup, because of an abysmal failure rate running from 56 to 76 percent over five different massive open online courses. A Chronicle blogger <a href="http://chronicle.com/blognetwork/tenuredradical/2013/07/f-is-for-failure-or-dont-invest-your-pension-in-moocs-yet/">offers a good read</a> on the underlying problems of MOOC trials at SJSU, although others suggest that Udacity’s bust <a href="https://twitter.com/Elijah_Meeks/status/359090677654630401">should be thought of as online education’s “Pets.com”</a>, an early failure of paradigm-shifting online retail. And some <a href="https://twitter.com/jtheibault/status/357604686162968576">just don’t want to talk about the M-word at all</a>.</p>

<p>I’ve little to add to the larger debate over the place of MOOCs in the future of higher ed writ large. From my own small corner though, I’m interested if open courses could be useful to graduate students who find themselves needing to supplement their program’s coursework with ancillary technical or administrative skills, like scripting languages or grant writing.</p>

<p>Could the current surplus of technical MOOCs be especially useful for budding digital humanities scholars? In the spirit of trying it before I knock it, I’ve enrolled in a <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/sna">MOOC on social network analysis</a> for this fall, and a faculty colleague will be working through one on <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/maps">GIS</a>. We’ll find out soon enough.</p>

	<p><a href="http://www.ischool.drexel.edu/bigdata/bigdata2013/">IEEE BigData 2013</a> is going to be accompanied this year by a two-day workshop on “big data” applications in the humanities. Some promising-sounding <a href="http://bighumanities.net/">topics from their CFP</a> include:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>Text- and data-mining of historical and archival material.</li>
    <li>Social media analysis, including sentiment analysis</li>
    <li>Cultural analytics</li>
    <li>Crowd-sourcing and big data</li>
    <li>Cyber-infrastructures for the humanities</li>
    <li>Relationship between “small data” and big data</li>
    <li>NoSQL databases and their application, e.g. document and graph databases</li>
    <li>Big data and the construction of memory and identity</li>
    <li>Big data and archival practice</li>
    <li>Construction of big data</li>
    <li>Big data in Heritage</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>They will be accepting long and short paper proposals until August 5.</p>

	<p><a href="/assets/images/rembrandt_google_doodle.png"><img src="/assets/images-display/rembrandt_google_doodle.png" alt="rembrandt google doodle" title="2013-07-15 Google doodle featuring Rembrandt's 1659 self-portrait now in the National Gallery of Art in Washington DC" /></a></p>

<p>Today’s <a href="http://www.google.com/doodles">Google doodle</a> celebrates Rembrandt van Rijn’s birthday 407 years ago in Leiden, and features one of his haunting <a href="http://www.nga.gov/fcgi-bin/tinfo_f?acc=1937.1.72">late self-portraits</a> that hangs today in the National Gallery of Art in Washington.</p>

<p>Sadly, Google missed out on an opportunity to make an even more delightful visual pun with Rembrandt’s slightly later c. 1665 self-portrait now in the Kenwood House in London, which features two circles that would fit perfectly into the middle of a large, painterly “G<strong>oo</strong>gle”.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/images/rembrandt_1665_kenwood.jpg"><img src="/assets/images-display/rembrandt_1665_kenwood.png" alt="rembrandt kenwood house 1665 self-portrait" title="Rembrandt's c. 1665 self-portrait now in the Kenwood House in London" /></a></p>

<p>If they had chosen this self-portarit, Google would have added yet another layer to these enigmatic circles, which have spurred no small amount of scholarly debate over the decades.</p>

<p>It was B. P. J. Broos who established in 1971 what is likely the best explanation for the circles: that they allude to stories of past master artists famed for their skill with line.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> The legendary artists of Greek antiquity, Apelles and Protogenes, were said to have competed with each other over who could paint the finest, most perfect line. This trope of linear mastery gained its own twist in Karel van Mander’s seventeenth-century biography of the early Italian renaissance painter Giotto. Van Mander tells us how Giotto demonstrated his skill to a representative of a potential patron, Pope Benedict IX:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Giotto was witty; he took a sheet of paper and holding his arm against his side to act as a compass, he drew on it, with a turn of the hand, never moving his arm, a circle so perfect that it was a wonder to see. Having done this, he gave it to the courtier with a grin, saying: there is the drawing. Whereupon the courtier, thinking himself made fun of, answered: am I to have no other drawing than this? This is more than enough, said Giotto, show it to the Pope with the rest, and you shall see whether or not it will be appreciated. He left ill-satisfied. When this drawing came before the Pope among others, and when he had been told in what manner it was drawn by Giotto, without a compass 
and with a stiff arm, the Pope and his many judicious courtiers understood that Giotto was the best painter of his time.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">2</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Broos showed how the perfect circle shows up again and again in Dutch images from the period, such as Rembrandt’s <a href="http://www.nga.gov/content/ngaweb/Collection/art-object-page.9961.html">1658 etched portrait</a> of the virtuoso Amsterdam calligrapher Lieven Willemszoon van Coppenol. So while Rembrandt shows us an aged, somewhat disheveled figure in the foreground of this self-portrait, the background reminds us that behind that timeworn face is a skilled, modern-day artist who can match the feats of the old masters, and remain in the history books, not to mention museums, more than four centuries later.</p>

	<p>Moving to the <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> blogging platform doesn’t save me a significant amount of time versus WordPress. But it is more customizable, and I’m choosing to count my now improved/refreshed Ruby, CSS, and webhosting knowledge towards the total value of the migration project (ergo I think I may still be on the good side of <a href="http://xkcd.com/1205/">this chart</a>.)</p>

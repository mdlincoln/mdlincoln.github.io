This approach was a natural first step. The ULAN's structure is artist-centric; creating a list of nodes meant reading the list from top to bottom, creating a list of edges was essentially the same task.

      <div class="excerpt">A recent graduate of our department is exploring digital dissemination of the core discovery in his dissertation. The thought process that led him to this discovery is uniquely well-suited to a digital visualization ([a hobby-horse of mine](http://matthewlincoln.net/2013/05/22/aesthetic-provocations.html)) hosted on a personal website. He is torn, however, between the imperative to market his own work and the fear of "cheapening" his scholarship through digital publication, as well as the not-totally-unjustified fear of theft.

I came away with new contacts, fresh ideas, and some clearer signposts as to which skill paths I should pursue. That said, I also came away with tempered expectations for my next THATCamp experience a more critical outlook on the ebullient rhetoric surrounding the un-conference model. Take a look at [#THATCamp on Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23thatcamp) to get a taste of the bubbly enthusiasm.

      <div class="excerpt"><p>Something interesting that cropped up while I was on vacation last week. The design agency [Accurat](http://accurat.it) (which has developed several other novel visualizations of cultural texts and histories) has created intriguing infographics [visualizing ten modern painters' lives](http://www.flickr.com/photos/accurat/sets/72157633953437972/with/8961090343/). (hat tip: [hyperallergic](http://hyperallergic.com/76259/10-painters-lives-chronicled-as-infographics/) via the [MSCVC](https://twitter.com/MSCollaboratory/status/360456068507250688))

[![Visualising Painters' Lives by accurat.it, on Flickr][lives]](http://www.flickr.com/photos/accurat/8961090259/)

[lives]: http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3806/8961090259_ba40cf018d_c.jpg "Visualising Painters' Lives by accurat.it, on Flickr"

They have structured the infographics as multi-layered timelines marked with single-point events, spans of time indicating things such as a career in a studio or academy, or a romantic or professional relationship. Affixed to these representations of the artist's life are timelines of their work signposted with landmark paintings, sigils rendered in the color schemes observed at that phase in the painter's career, and histograms that claim to mark out that artist's participation in a certain artistic school or movement. The iconography is delightfully idiosyncratic, shaped to resemble motifs that have come to be associated with each of the ten artists.


[![Detail from Henri Matisse][matisse]](/assets/images/matisselegend.png)

[matisse]: /assets/images/matisselegend.png "Detail of the histogram legend from the Matisse infographic. By accurat.it"


I'm particularly interested in the histograms charting artwork style, size, and palette. Accurat did a particularly admirable job visualizing the many schools and movements interweaved through each artist's oeuvre: color-coded words are clustered and stacked near concentrations of paintings that exhibit a certain style, e.g. expressionism or cubism. But because bars on the histogram are keyed to these colors, it is also possible to clearly indicate one instance of late cubism in Matisse's oeuvre, while still legibly showing that most of his experimentation with that style happened earlier in his life.

Some errant thoughts on the project:

- While Accurat points out these graphs are by no means comprehensive or "scientific", they mention that they drew data from open online databases like Wikipedia, so I wonder to what extent they automated this process.

- Could one do something similar with data culled from [ARTstor](http://artstor.org), which has very solid date and repository information, or [artsy](http://artsy.net/), which has tagged a wealth of works with more squishy metadata like color and movement?

- A histogram of different styles works quite well for the exhaustively-taxonimized twentieth century, but I suspect this might not be quite as illuminating for earlier periods that haven't been dissected into named stylistic movements. Maybe it would be productive to make a histogram of genres (portraits, landscapes, altarpieces) or sizes and compositional schemes.

      <div class="excerpt"><p>In my [last](http://matthewlincoln.net/2013/06/20/looking-through-the-ulan-with-gephi.html) [two](http://matthewlincoln.net/2013/06/24/visualizing-the-ulan-through-gephi-ii.html) posts on using Gephi to read the Getty Union List of Artist Names, I have been straightforwardly visualizing the relationships explicitly described by the dataset. This approach was a natural first step. The ULAN's structure is artist-centric; creating a list of nodes meant reading the list from top to bottom, creating a list of edges was essentially the same task.

      <div class="excerpt"><p>The "flipped" or "inverted" classroom is a hot trend in higher-ed ([peruse the *Chronicle*'s archives](http://chronicle.com/search/?search_siteId=5&contextId=&action=rem&searchQueryString=flipped) to get an idea.) In brief, the instructor in a flipped classroom channels most of their content delivery (lectures, readings) *outisde* the classroom, often through screencasts students can watch on their own time. This frees up time in the classroom for critical discussion, questions, and student collaboration, thus taking advantage of the best part of a traditional classroom: having bodies in the room! (Or [seated on ends of a log](http://archives.williams.edu/williamshistory/greylock/mhopkins.php), if, like me, you prefer a Williams College analogy.)

      <div class="excerpt"><p>> Honthorst, the successful court painter in The Hague, had, while he still flourished as an artist, a lively brush; but, whether it was to please the girls, or because money lulled him to sleep, he fell into a stiff smoothness: about which Linschoten, who was used to attacking his work lustily, taunted him, saying that Honthorst could no longer do a worthwhile stroke. “All the same,” replied the latter, “I do better strokes than you every day of the week, and I’ll show you one you can’t repeat.” So saying, he pulled a handful of ducats from his purse, shoved them on the table, and stroked them towards him, by which he meant to show that with his painting, however it might look, he knew how to earn money, whereas Linschoten, with his broad brush, was still a poor man.

      <div class="excerpt"><p>A recent graduate of our department is exploring digital dissemination of the core discovery in his dissertation. The thought process that led him to this discovery is uniquely well-suited to a digital visualization ([a hobby-horse of mine](http://matthewlincoln.net/2013/05/22/aesthetic-provocations.html)) hosted on a personal website. He is torn, however, between the imperative to market his own work and the fear of "cheapening" his scholarship through digital publication, as well as the not-totally-unjustified fear of theft.

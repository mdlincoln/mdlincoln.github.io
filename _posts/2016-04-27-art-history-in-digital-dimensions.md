I'm really excited to make public the CFP for an event that will be taking place at the University of Maryland (sponsored by both Kress and Getty) this fall discussing and debating the digital dimensions of art history: <http://dah-dimensions.org/>

This is very much a **Call for Participation**, rather than papers:
the event will comprise a series of roundtables and breakout working groups tasked with identifying core issues, problems, and opportunities posed for the discipline by computing and the digital (and, I hope, the challenges art history poses for computing!)
Among other results, we aim to produce a white paper (to be compiled by Diane Zorich) reporting on the conversations that happen there.

We already have a brilliant corps of invited participants, but we want to make sure that we get the broadest array of perspectives that we can, hence an open call for additional participants.
**Travel and lodging is funded by the Kress and Getty for accepted participants.**
You can see the full description below.
Please don't hesitate to ping me if you have any questions, and please forward along to your respective institutions/listservs!

>With the support of the Getty Foundation and the Samuel H. Kress Foundation, the [Department of Art History and Archaeology](http://arthistory.umd.edu/) and the [Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities](http://mith.umd.edu/) (MITH) of the [University of Maryland, College Park](http://www.umd.edu/), present Art History in Digital Dimensions, a three-day symposium in Washington, D.C. and College Park. The symposium aims to unite diverse audiences and practitioners in a critical intervention for the digital humanities and digital art history, providing a cogent and inclusive road map for the future.
>
>The symposium will begin at The Phillips Collection on Wednesday, October 19 with a keynote lecture given by [Paul B. Jaskot](http://dah-dimensions.org/participants/), Professor of Art History at DePaul University, on the theme "Why Digital Art History?" On Thursday and Friday, October 20-21, sessions in College Park will include roundtables, break-out sessions, lightning round presentations, and plenaries. Topics of discussion will include collaborative, trans-disciplinary models of research; the implications of data-driven approaches to art history and the humanities; legal and ethical obligations of scholars and museum professionals engaging art history in the digital world; and the innovative array of objects for study presupposed by digital art history.
>
>We are seeking 15 participants, including 5 graduate students, to join in the conversation with 25 invited contributors. We aim to engage a multi-generational cross-section of the art-historical community, including senior, mid-career, and emerging scholars, as well as a wide range of institutional perspectives, from higher education to museums. Ideal participants will have experience from the academy and/or museum in art-historical research practices that intersect with the digital realm.
>
>To apply, please submit a CV and a personal statement (maximum of 500 words) that describes your involvement in and ambitions for digital art history, with particular attention to the perspective you might bring to the symposium as an engaged participant. Send materials in a single PDF file to [dah-dimensions@gmail.com](mailto:dah-dimensions@gmail.com) by **May 30, 2016**. Participants will receive funding for travel and accommodation.

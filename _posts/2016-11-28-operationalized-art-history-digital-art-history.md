[In my post on a new article in _British Art Studies_](/2016/11/28/temporal-dimensions.html), I highlighted the methodological move of "operationalization".
This is not novel --- indeed, the approach has been _de rigueur_ for decades in experimental design across a wide array of the physical and social sciences.
But I think it's important to keep repeating the idea for art historians, and to note what makes it distinct from "digital" art history, and even from "data-driven" art history.

**Warning: precisely none of this will be new ground for any DHers out there.**

## Electric Toasters and "DAH"

In the past two months I've been hearing a lot about "digital art history", in particular at the UMD workshop on the [Digital Dimensions of Art History](http://dah-dimensions.org/).
A common refrain has been that "digital art history" will soon just be "art history".
This might be true, but only for some definitions of "digital art history."

"Digital publishing", for example, should eventually begin to sound like "electric toaster" in our discipline, much as "digital images" have entirely replaced lantern slides, and "digital word processing" and "electronic mail" are _far and away_ our modes of scholarly textual communication now.

I do hope that the conscious use of art historical data, even if that use is at the micro scale, involving no fancy computation, will also become so commonplace as to not draw special remark.
Ours has long been a data-dependent discipline, even if that data has been usually been formatted in printed catalogues raisonn√© and in annotated bibliographies.
I'd hope that more basic self-awareness of data --- not only its constructedness, but also its indissoluble role in our discipline --- becomes normalized within art history writ large, it' study and use not relegated to the corners of some "digital art history" subfield.

What will _not_ become "just art history", however, are operationalized and computational approaches to our research questions.
The literacies required are too specialized, and the benefits too specific, to constitute a methodological school that ought to be internalized by every art historian.
Yes, there are some questions (say, trying to make claims about a very large set of objects or individuals) for which it should become natural and expected (or even required by peer reviewers!) to engage with computation at some level.
But the lion's share of art historical work, dealing in close looking at a handful of objects, will never demand this type of methodology.
And that's just fine.

But it means that "_computational_ art history" won't simply disappear into the larger discipline.
Today, you can be an art historian who has a particular methodological specialization in semiotics, post-colonial theory, or intellectual history, to name a few.
So, too, should there be some art historians, like myself, whose research agendas are shaped not only by their particular interests in a given period or subject, but also (or even primarily) by their interest in operationalizing research questions at scale to affirm and challenge canonical narratives, and to deliver novel perspectives on, for example, causation and uncertainty, for the larger field to engage with, critique, and even adapt for their own non-computational work.

## Art Historical Infrastructure

Even if "digital art history" and "operationalized art history" are distinct, their normalization has real consequences for planning the infrastructure of our field over the next ten or twenty years.

As online publication as well as more involved and collaborative digital workflows become fully normalized in art history, our academic departments, museums, and research institutes will need to adapt to support those demands through more proactive project management that facilitates collaboration between scholars, publishers, developers, and librarians.
Even if we don't have to go around calling these practices "digital art history", this shift _does_ mean new expectations, and new organizational structures to meet them.

That more specialized branch of art history that will turn in a dedicated way into computation will absolutely depend on this broader infrastructure for the creation and organization of the data that it needs.
However it also has some rather traditional needs in academic infrastructure: a support system of advanced institutes and visiting scholar programs to spark interdisciplinary work

I finally got the chance to push through a little idea about walking through visual time with a new bot called [@MechaKubler]

[@MechaKubler]: (https://www.twitter.com/mechakubler)

Once an hour, it assembles an 8-image-long path between two objects from the Rijksmusem, trying to find pictures that are roughly evenly separated in the visual space defined by the features generated by the [VGG-18 CNN][vgg18].
Rather than just find the closest object at hand, it will take a chronological path, expressly moving either forwards or backwards in time as it traverses this visual space.
Hence the homage to George Kubler, who considered the seriation of visual form through history in his 1962 _Shape of Time_.
One of his core arguments was that there exist "prime objects": ideal solutions to visual problems that artists then manifest through physical variants.
This not unlike how [@MechaKubler] works. Using [a R package I wrote to generate point paths through matrices](github.com/mdlincoln/pathway), it identifies several ideal points sitting on a line evenly spaced between two randomly-chosen objects.

[vgg18]:

These ideal points in the VGG-18 feature space can't be directly translated back into images - alone, they're just separate lists of 512 numbers.
So while it's impossible to see what these "prime object" points look like, we can get a glimpse of that path via real objects acting as surrogates for those points.
"Visual similarity" in [@MechaKubler] careens between the sublime and the absurd. It gets hung up on things like large book gutters or oval frames. Its pathways get snared in eddies of preparatory sketches and exhibition installation photos.
But it also snags onto serendipitous resonances of pose like that between Winter and Salome here:

Also critical: Kubler was very much interested in causality.
[@MechaKubler] is very much not.
It knows nothing about artists' circumstances or location or community or patrons etc.

So this bot doesn't make individual art history arguments.
But it does, I think, give us more cause to question how we define ideal/prime objects in our arguments.
We scrape together visual representations of these ideal arguments through whatever surviving objects we can find that fit best.
Those are constrained by everything from our foundational image-collecting habits and scholarly canons to things as mundane as reproduction rights.
So anyway, [take some time to check out the weird paths it finds](https://mechanical-kubler.github.io).
It's definitely prompted me to look more closely at more objects than I've done in a long time.

I may experiment a bit in the future with adding some other kinds of constraints, like paintings-only or ceramics-only paths.
Also the actual feature space could be drastically improved by using a fine-tuned CNN like the [Replica] project, so I may give that a go at some point
And if you like [@MechaKubler] you should also take a look at some forebears like Ryan Baumann's [search for close matches across this corpus using Pastec](https://ryanfb.github.io/etc/2015/11/03/finding_near-matches_in_the_rijksmuseum_with_pastec.html), John Resig's [Ukiyo-e visual search engine](https://ukiyo-e.org/about), and the [Barnes Collection's computer vision experiments](https://medium.com/barnes-foundation/stuffed-animals-computer-vision-and-the-barnes-foundation-collection-online-ed787d3baded).

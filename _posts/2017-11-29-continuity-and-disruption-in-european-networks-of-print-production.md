  Continuity and Disruption: Print Production Networks in _Artl@s Bulletin_

A great special issue of the _Artl@s Bulletin_ on challenges and opportunities for art historical network analysis is now out, featuring [another component of my research into early modern etching & engraving networks][purdue].
I focus on the (ahistorical?) phenomenon of national schools and their less-than-perfect fit to the relationships documented by the artworks themselves:

>As we will see, these modern labels do not overlay comfortably over the topological communities in these production networks. However, by understanding _when_ these production communities diverge from present-day classifications, we will gain a more fluid and dynamic understanding of how communities of practice interacted during this golden age of European printmaking.

For those following along, you may recognize this question from a post I made several years ago on [confabulation in the humanities](/2015/03/21/confabulation-in-the-humanities.html) when I was just starting to puzzle through these questions.

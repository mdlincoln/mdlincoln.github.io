I'm incredibly pleased to say that a paper co-authored with my awesome UMD colleague Abram Fox - a paper 2.5 years in the making - is finally out today, open access, in [_British Art Studies_](https://doi.org/10.17658/issn.2058-5462/issue-04/afox-mlincoln)

>The rush of activity among London's auction houses in the first few weeks of summer has long been a familiar occurrence that persists even today. 
However, this intense seasonal concentration of sales was not always so. 
This paper draws on quantitative methods to explore the gradual emergence of a tightly scheduled auction season in London at the turn of the nineteenth century, focusing on the sale of paintings. 
Through the use of historical auction catalogue data, the paper traces the ways in which this shift varied across different segments of the auction market, as well as between individual auction houses. 
As our study shows, the temporal clustering of painting auctions had specific business advantages, but it also played a key role in enhancing the social import of these auctions, demarcating an annual, weeks-long "event" looked to with anticipation and excitement by auctioneers and buyers alike.

A little backstory: the germ of this paper came from a [post on this blog back in March of 2014](/2014/03/17/doing-the-season-historic-art-sale-calendars.html) when I had first started toying with data from the [Getty Provenance Index](http://www.getty.edu/research/tools/provenance/search.html).
(Little did I know [where I'd be working](/2016/08/05/new-beginnings-data-research-at-the-getty-research-institute.html) by the time this article came out!)

# Abstract

The *Mira calligraphiae monumenta* is one of the most intriguing objects of the
kusntkammer of Rudolf II. The creators of this layered work never met each
other; Georg Bocskay, secretary for Ferdinand I, penned the manuscript’s
calligraphic displays in 1561-2, while Joris Hoefnagel was commissioned by
Rudolf three decades later to illuminate this treasure with brilliantly rendered
flora and fauna. It has been argued that Hoefnagel’s additions establish a
*paragone* between the painted image and the written word, his illusionistic
*naturalia* surpassing Bocskay’s page-bound *artificialia*. It has been further
argued that the outcome of this *paragone* reflects a Paracelsian philosophy
shared by the Rudolfine court: that true knowledge can only come from natural
investigation and not from secondary texts. However, this interpretation elides
the complexities of magical and occult studies in Prague. The diverse schools of
occult thought entertained at the Rudolfine court also included that of Heinrich
Cornelius Agrippa, who believed inscribed signs had the capacity to become
sigils endowed with power over the natural world. I argue that the complex
formal interplay of text and image on certain pages of the *MCM* at times
suggests that Bocskay’s scripts indeed hold sway over Hoefnagel’s natural
objects. This suggests that even as Rudolf and his court appreciated the *MCM*
for its aesthetic beauty and inventiveness, these semiotically-intelligent
readers must also have related its formally-cohesive tableaus of text and nature
to sixteenth-century occult notions of the physical power of the inscribed sign
investigated in their own court.

Introduction[^1]
================

**(SLIDE 2)** This stunning illuminated page comes from one of the most
enchanting objects to survive from the collections of the Holy Roman
Emperor Rudolf II: the *Mira calligraphiae monumenta* (or *MCM*), now in
the J. Paul Getty Museum.[^2] This curious artwork was made by two
separate artists who never met each other: Georg Bocskay, who created a
small *wunderkammer* of historical alphabets and calligraphic displays
in 1561-62; and Joris Hoefnagel, who added floral and insect
illuminations to the codex between 1591-1596, uniting the *artificialia*
of man-made calligraphy with a host of *naturalia* precisely depicted in
enticing gem tones.

The *MCM* is a fascinating component of the long history of Northern
European manuscript illumination. It is also a beautiful example late
sixteenth-century courtly interest in collecting wondrous man-made and
natural artifacts. These stories have been brilliantly told by scholars
like Thomas DaCosta Kaufmann, Lee Hendrix, and Thea Vignau-Wilberg,
among many others. Today I seek to shed just a little more light on one
corner of the *MCM* story: its intersection with Rudolf’s study of
magic and the occult.[^3] To be clear, the purpose of the *MCM* was not
explicitly magical. That said, I argue that its unique presentation of
text and nature cannot be fully understood without reference to
contemporary theories of magic. The *MCM*’s visual juxtapositions
reverberate with early modern occult theories according to which
inscribed signs were endowed with the ability transcend their status as
symbolic marks, becoming magically powerful sigils with real effect in
the physical universe. The *MCM* alludes to these occult ideas so
consistently that I will argue Rudolf and other courtly viewers must
have understood the codex – at least partly – in magical terms.

Describing the *Mira calligraphiae monumenta*
=============================================

**(SLIDE 3)** Bocskay created the writing model book while serving as
court secretary for Ferdinand I, the Holy Roman Emperor from 1556-64.
The work remained in the imperial collections in Vienna until 1591, when
Ferdinand’s grandson Rudolf II commissioned Hoefnagel to illuminate the
codex.[^4] By engaging Hoefnagel to enhance Ferdinand’s artwork, Rudolf
was surely mindful of the dynastic significance of adding his own mark
on one of his grandfather’s artworks. He was at once signaling both
dynastic continuity as well as his unique personal identity –
considerations that informed everything from his coronation celebrations
to his moving the imperial seat to Prague from Vienna.

Bocskay’s calligraphy is a wonder to behold. The hands are partly
elaborate historical scripts, and partly novel inventions.[^5] Page
after page bears Bocskay’s virtuosic calligraphy: letters with ascending
and descending serifs so long that they interweave into their own
decorative patterns, or encrusted ornaments that all but obscure the
letters they ostensibly decorate. **(SLIDE 4)** This is not an
educational handbook, but a true display piece of extreme
virtuosity.[^6] On some pages Bocskay even wrote in reverse, likely a
particular challenge when penning Gothic blackletter.

Hoefnagel, for his part, ingeniously responded to the form and
composition of Bocskay’s pre-existing scripts, stunning the viewer with
a diversity of delicate, masterfully-modeled flora and fauna. On page
after page he adds a blend of fruits, vegetables and vines, flowers in
varying points of bloom, insects, spiders, and even the occasional small
mouse or frog. With these additions, the *MCM* becomes an exceptional
hybrid of virtuosic writing and painting, perfectly fit for the Prague
*wunderkammer* in which Rudolf aimed to collect a representation of both
the natural and man-made world through its most spectacular and wondrous
products.[^7]

Our first instinct as art historians is to identify symbolic,
iconographic connections between Bocskay’s and Hoefnagel’s contributions
to this codex. And yet we will find that the *MCM* pointedly resists
this path of inquiry. Lee Hendrix and Thea Vignau-Wilberg have both
noted that the particular species of flora and fauna Hoefnagel added to
the codex have no systematic connection to the texts Bocskay used to
demonstrate his calligraphy, which range from Biblical excerpts,
prayers, and hymns, to passages of courtly correspondence.[^8] In fact,
a great deal of the *naturalia* are imaginary, with no real-world
counterparts.[^9] Let us remember that someone favored enough to be
allowed access to this codex would have been thoroughly trained in the
traditional Renaissance humanist language of iconography that privileged
symbolic relationships. In the face of this convention, the notable
absence of symbolic relationships is itself a sign that some other
signifying scheme is afoot.

**(SLIDE 5)** Further perusal suggests our focus ought to lie not so
much in symbolic relationships, but visual ones. In one of the more
delightful additions, Hoefnagel paints the stem of a flower piercing the
page as if it were a real bloom tucked away for safekeeping.[^10] Like
any of the other semblances of physical volume that Hoefnagel creates,
the illusion reveals itself as soon as the viewer reaches out to touch
the flower, to find only the material of the page below. Yet the ersatz
cut in the paper entices the viewer to visually test what they have
already confirmed through touch: because this is not a real slice, the
back of the page must surely be blank and unmarred. **(SLIDE 6)** Not
so! Hoefnagel wittily continues the illusion on the verso of this folio
page, giving us a painted glimpse of the flower stem running through the
perforated sheet. This second illusion greets our attempted confirmation
of the first, reminding us precisely how much we had come to disbelieve
our own senses on account of Hoefnagel’s displays of visual wit.

**(SLIDE 7)** In these additions to the *MCM*, Hoefnagel draws on the
tradition of devotional manuscript illumination, in which artists
negotiated increasingly volumetric and complex images onto the “flat”
text-bearing surface of the page.[^11] For example, in this late
fifteenth-century book of hours, the illuminator depicted pilgrimage
badges seemingly pinned to the vellum of the page, alluding to the real
practices of well-to-do pilgrims who would collect in these devotional
books badges, or even flowers, obtained from a holy site.[^12] Yet here
any relationship to the semantic content of the text (already
overwhelmed by Bocskay’s florid scripts) is abandoned.

**(SLIDE 8)** This visual interweaving suggests that Hoefnagel
constructed his illuminations to induce sustained *visual* comparison
with the forms of Bocskay’s calligraphy. However, a careful examination
of the *MCM* suggests no clear victor in this artistic *paragone*. A
painted flower stem seeming to pierce the page does, on the one hand,
highlight the primacy of illustrations that can simulate
three-dimensionality.[^13] Yet this reading co-exists with its mutually
exclusive complement: the flower may flatten the script, yet Hoefnagel
paints the stem of the flower passing through the page at precisely the
point where one of Bocscay’s dramatic flourishes plunges into the empty
page. It is as if Hoefnagel is deliberately avoiding one of Bocskay’s
inviolate characters.[^14]

At several points in the codex Hoefnagel similarly re-routes his
illuminations so as if to avoid the extant lettering. At other times,
his illuminations seem to interact with the letters as if they were
physically present forms: **(SLIDE 9)** a spider spins a web that is
anchored at several points of the text; an imaginary insect perches on
the side of a character; **(SLIDE 10)** another spider hangs off the end
of a word; a white butterfly alights on an illustrated capital; **(SLIDE
11)** a rather vicious-looking stinging insect sits on the ink border
framing a block of text, nicely echoing a particularly spiny flower at
left; and in one notable instance, Hoefnagel even invests Bocskay’s
scripts with architectonic power, adding his own frame to make a
volumetric receding ceiling out of the wedge of text. Rather than
subverting Bocskay’s scripts, Hoefnagel invests the written forms with
apparent influence on his illuminated *naturalia*.

Rudolf II and Courtly Magic
===========================

**(SLIDE 12)** How would Rudolf and his court have situated this hybrid
artwork in their intellectual universe? Looking to contemporary occult
study in Prague suggests an intriguing avenue. Like many European rulers
of the 16th century, Rudolf devoted no small amount of resources to
occult study. Patronage of occult sciences, much like patronage of the
visual arts, was very much an exercise in self-fashioning. Astrologers,
alchemists, and engineers granted patrons a dual social boon: the
appearance of both wisdom as well as power, genuine social currency for
the early modern ruler who was expected to posses *sapientia* and
*potentia* as crucial elements of princely *virtù*. William Eamon has
suggested that magical study was an ideal courtly practice, as magic
promised rare and wondrous feats accomplished through mysterious forces
not obvious to the viewer. This seeming effortlessness attracted princes
eager to pursue Castiglione’s image of the ideal courtier.[^15]

Rudolf’s sponsorship of occult study was uniquely wide-ranging among the
European courts, genuinely promoting the formulation of correspondences
across disciplines and between schools of occult thought, much like the
associations he promoted between wondrous objects filling the Prague
*kunstkammer*. This collection of wonders both natural and man-made
modeled the structure of Creation through it’s most exceptional
constituents.[^16] A vibrant program of occult study aimed at discerning
the hidden structures of the world naturally dovetailed with the mission
of the *kunstkammer* in both representing and effecting Rudolf’s control
over the world.

Over the years of his rule, many researchers of the Paracelsian bent of
Hermeticism worked in his court, such as Michael Maier, Heinrich
Kunrath, and Oswald Croll.[^17] Paracelsian occultism rejected
scholastic canonical authorities as a source of hidden truth, saying
that secret knowledge of the world cannot come from reading human books
(i.e. secondary sources) but only from reading directly from the
greatest primary source of all: the “Book of Nature”.[^18] Lee Hendrix
has argued that the *MCM* visualizes Paracelsian philosophy by making
literal the idea that nature transcended mere written words. Hoefnagel’s
illuminations, she asserts, “confront the viewer” with the remoteness of
text compared to the rich immediacy of nature.[^19]

**(SLIDE 13)** However the Cabbalist tradition also had a strong
presence at the court. We know Rudolf had his horoscope not only cast,
but illustrated by Hoefnagel himself. Rudolf studied Hebrew extensively,
and was associated with Rabbi Judah Loew, the Supreme Chief Rabbi of
Bohemia and a figure of legend down to today for animating the Golem of
Prague from lifeless mud using a parchment talisman inscribed with
Hebrew and inserted in the creature’s mouth.[^20] Rudolf’s own
chancellors owned copies of Pico della Mirandola’s *Cabalistarum
dogmata*, and Rudolf’s private confessor, Johannes Pistorius, was
himself a Christian Cabbalist.[^21]As part of this occult project,
Rudolf also had printed the quasi-cabbalist manuscripts by Johannes
Trithemius that had gone unpublished for almost a century. The early
sixteenth-century occult works of Trithemius’ protégé Cornelius Agrippa
also circulated, and it is his occult theories in particular that may
have provided a magical lens through which Rudolf and others may have
viewed *MCM*.

Text and Nature
===============

**(SLIDE 14)** Agrippa wrote *De occulta philosophia* in 1533. Despite
its initial controversial reception, copies of the book existed in
Rudolf’s library in the late sixteenth-century.[^22] In this book
Agrippa presented methods for constructing powerful sigils. You can see
some of the process on the page to the right: starting from a grid of
select Hebrew characters, converted by *gematria* into a table of
numbers, the occultist may then follow a set of calculations to trace
lines between a series of numbers, lines that produce a character
mathematically embedded, or occluded, within a significant Hebrew word.
Inscribed on the proper materials and deployed in the correct manner,
these sigils could effect changes in the weather, in animals, and even
influence the thoughts and behavior of humans.[^23]

Most interesting for our understanding of the *MCM* is Agrippa’s
underlying theory of signification (and here I borrow extensively from
Christopher Lehrich’s recent close reading of *De Occulta Philosophia*
through our modern-day semiotic triad of *symbolic*, *iconic*, and
*indexical* signs). Agrippa’s sigils were powerful because precisly they
were *not* simply arbitrary *symbolic* representations of objects. Being
systematically constructed from Hebrew – a divinely-inspired language
unlike man’s modern, arbitrary tongues – these sigils had an *indexical*
relationship to Creation, their form being a functional result of a
mathematical process. Moreover, in Agrippa’s view, these sigils had an
*iconic* relationship to nature as well: they visually reflected the
geometries of the heavenly spheres that had powerful influence over
earthly creation. Perhaps most importantly, these sigils’ power was
transitive, not only reflecting creation but potentially able to affect
it as well. The original sign, the *logos* of God, had this power: God
spoke, *therefore* the cosmos was created. Because Agrippa’s sigils were
constructed from Hebrew, they were close enough to the *logos* to have
real influence on the natural elements that both signified and were
signified by these sigils.[^24] Yet theoretically, even the distant
children of Hebrew still had a tenuous connection to this divine
originating power. For Agrippa and related theorists, language need not
be a pale, arbitrary representation of the natural world, but could
rather be inextricably embedded within it. Magical characters were not
powerful because of their syllogistic relationships to objects or
concepts; they were powerful because they were, in essence, images.[^25]

**(SLIDE 15)** When first considering the *MCM*, we struggled to locate
systematic symbolic relationships between the text and the
illuminations. While Hoefnagel subverted any such iconographic
relationships, he reliably mimicked the calligraphic shapes of Bocskay’s
script, creating pleasing visual correspondences of forms: interweaving
flourishes echo the crisscrossing spines of a love-in-a-mist plant; the
round peas within bulbous pods evoke the decorative baubles surrounding
the text they accompany; **(SLIDE 16)** sinuous curves run along the
page not unlike the curvaceous slug sitting in the lower margin; the
curlicues of a flourish suggest the whizzing, spiraling motion of the
bee pictured in flight beneath them. **(SLIDE 17)** Even in the
instances where Hoefnagel defies the very integrity of the parchment
page with his *trompe l’oeil* effects, the plants deliberately avoid
marring the text, as if mysteriously repelled from the earlier path of
Bocskay’s pen. Rather than subverting the preexisting script, Hoefnagel
bonds it to his *naturalia* ever more strongly, constructing visual
worlds on each page dominated by iconic relationships so cohesive that
Bocskay’s texts cease to be knowledge-conveying language as such,
becoming images like Hoefnagel’s flora and fauna.

The *MCM*’s “message” is thus not an iconographic one, but a formal one.
It invites the viewer to contemplate the complex relationships of text
and nature on the page, and it does so in a way analogous to the
semiotic relationships explored by Cornelius Agrippa and other
Cabbalists. Hoefnagel drives the viewer to be self-aware of their own
assumptions about vision and meaning, frequently confounding our
understanding of the pictorial surface. At times the page is a
perspectival window one peers through as if into a space to see insects
climbing up the sides of words or the edges of the page. At other times
the pictorial surface is coincident with the page itself, so that the
viewer feels as if they are looking down onto actual snails creeping
along a very solid page. Pages like this one require the viewer to
switch back and forth between both these modes. Like Agrippa’s *De
occulta philosophia*, the *MCM* demanded a semiotically intelligent
reader intrigued by the idea that text and nature could have a
contingent relationship.

**(SLIDE 18)** Notably, one of the few pages of Bockscay’s calligraphy
book that Hoefnagel left unillustrated is this one. Bocskay inscribed
the Hebrew alphabet here in its entirety, copying the letters as well as
the banner motif wholesale from Giambattista Palatino’s 1541 *Libro
Nuovo*.[^26] Only the most virtuosically-inscribed passages of Latin,
German, and Italian have the potency in the *MCM* to nudge small insects
or errant leaves to one side or the other. By contrast, in its
simplicity and totality, the Hebrew alphabet stands utterly apart from
the encrusting illuminations in the in the MCM, privileged by Bocskay
and Hoefnagel much as it was by Agrippa and other Cabbalists for being
the only human language directly originating from god.

Conclusion
==========

**(SLIDE 19)** At the start of this paper I proposed that the *MCM* was
not explicitly magical. It is not itself a potent talisman or amulet. It
does not contain diagrams of magical theories or procedures. It does not
even depict the alchemist, astrologer, or magician in the midst of
occult practice. Yet all the same I argue that it is enmeshed in the
magical universe of Rudolfine Prague, for its unique visual idioms
mirror so well the theories of signification offered by Agrippa, and
other occult theorists read by the court. However by acknowledging the
resonances between its visual explorations and the full spectrum of
contemporary occult theory, we can better fit the *MCM* into our
understanding of magical and artistic culture in Prague. In doing so, I
hope this may spur the investigation of the intersection of Rudolfine
art and Rudolfine magic with renewed purpose. **(SLIDE 20)**

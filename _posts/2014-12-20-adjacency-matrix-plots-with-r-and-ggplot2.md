While the circle-and-line idiom used by many network visualization tools such as [Gephi] can be useful for investigating the structure of small- and medium-scale networks, large-scale network visualizations tend to turn the worst kinds of [spaghetti plots][spaghetti].

The abundance of crossing links creates a confusing visual pattern that masks the topological structure of the network.
Moreover, it is extremely difficult to compare two different networks from these visualizations, which rely on a randomized layout algorithm.

One good alternative is to visualize an [adjacency matrix][matrix] encoding the network relationship, with the nodes of the network listed on either axis, and each cell *AB* describing an edge connecting node *A* and node *B*.
[Mike Bostock has implemented this in D3][bostock], using Jacques Bretin's *Les Mis√©rables* co-occurrence network dataset.
It is also fairly easy to generate an adjacency matrix visualization using [ggplot2], but it does require that you bite the bullet and finally figure out how to work with [ordered factors][factors].[^2]
(What, me, project? Never...)

[^2]: Disclaimer: I'll also be making extensive use of Hadley Wickham's [dplyr] package, so if you aren't yet familiar with it, you'll be pretty lost. Don't worry, though, it's an easy package to pick up, and terribly useful!

## Calculate network properties

For this example, I will be working with an extract of a larger network database I have built of [connections between print engravers and publishers][print_networks] in the Netherlands in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth century.
I assume you are already starting with an [edge table][edge_table] for your network comprising rows with `from` and `to` variables, along with any number of edge attributes such as `weight`.
You may also have an additional table of [node attributes][node_table]; in my case, a table of the birth year for each artist.
I use the [igraph] package to augment these tables with calculated network statistics.

{% highlight R %}

library(igraph)
library(dplyr)

# Read in CSV files with edge and node attributes
original_edgelist <- read.csv("goltzius_graph.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
original_nodelist <- read.csv("goltzius_nodes.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Create iGraph object
graph <- graph.data.frame(original_edgelist, directed = TRUE, vertices = original_nodelist)

# Calculate various network properties, adding them as attributes
# to each node/vertex
V(graph)$comm <- membership(optimal.community(graph))
V(graph)$degree <- degree(graph)
V(graph)$closeness <- centralization.closeness(graph)$res
V(graph)$betweenness <- centralization.betweenness(graph)$res
V(graph)$eigen <- centralization.evcent(graph)$vector

{% endhighlight %}

After running these calculations, we now want to emit dataframes of nodes and edges with these additional attributes.
Because I would like to color the "edges" (i.e. matrix cells) of my plot based on community, I need to join the `comm` attributes of both the `from` and `to` nodes to my edge list, and then generate an "edge community" variable based on the matchup between `comm.x` and `comm.y`.

{% highlight R %}

# Re-generate dataframes for both nodes and edges, now containing
# calculated network attributes
node_list <- get.data.frame(graph, what = "vertices")

# Determine a community for each edge. If two nodes belong to the
# same community, label the edge with that community. If not,
# the edge community value is 'NA'
edge_list <- get.data.frame(graph, what = "edges") %>%
  inner_join(node_list %>% select(name, comm), by = c("from" = "name")) %>%
  inner_join(node_list %>% select(name, comm), by = c("to" = "name")) %>%
  mutate(group = ifelse(comm.x == comm.y, comm.x, NA) %>% factor())

{% endhighlight %}

# Create a matrix plot

To make sure that both plot axes display every network node, we need to tweak the factor levels for our `from` and `to` variables before plotting, so that each contains every *possible* level (i.e., every node in the network).

{% highlight R %}

# Adjust the 'to' and 'from' factor levels so that they contain
# every possible node value
all_nodes <- sort(node_list$name)
plot_data <- edge_list %>% mutate(
        to = factor(to, levels = all_nodes),
        from = factor(from, levels = all_nodes)))

# Create the adjacency matrix plot
ggplot(plot_data, aes(x = from, y = to, fill = group)) +
      geom_raster() +
      theme_bw() +
      # Because we need the x and y axis to display every node,
      # not just the nodes that have connections to each other,
      # make sure that ggplot does not drop unused factor levels
      scale_x_discrete(drop = FALSE) +
      scale_y_discrete(drop = FALSE) +
      theme(
        # Rotate the x-axis lables so they are legible
        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 270, hjust = 0),
        # Force the plot into a square aspect ratio
        aspect.ratio = 1,
        # Hide the legend (optional)
        legend.position = "none")

[![Adjacency plot with nodes arranged alphabetically](/assets/images/adjmatrix_alpha.png)](/assets/images/adjmatrix_alpha.png)

By default, ggplot will order the axes alphabetically by the names of each of your nodes.
I'd wager that most network topologies are not correlated to the names of their constituent nodes.[^1]
To get a more meaningful visualization, we need to reorder our axes.

[^1]: Leave a comment, though, if you have an example that does!

# Reorder the plot axes

ggplot orders its axes based on factor levels of the vector it is mapped to.
Therefore, to reorder our axes, we need to reorder our `from` and `to` factors based on the different node attributes that we calculated using igraph.
Let's try ordering the nodes based on their community membership:

{% highlight R %}

# Create a character vector of node names sorted by their
# community membership. Here, I rearrange the node_list
# table by the "group" variable, then extract the
# "name" vector
name_order <- (node_list %>% arrange(group))$name

# Reorder edge_list "from" and "to" factor levels based on
# this new name_order
plot_data <- edge_list %>% mutate(
        to = factor(to, levels = name_order),
        from = factor(from, levels = name_order)))

# Now run the ggplot code again

{% endhighlight %}

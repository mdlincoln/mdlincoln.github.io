I had the pleasure of being interviewed by data librarian superstar [Thomas Padilla](http://www.thomaspadilla.org) for a new column he's starting at [dh + lib](http://acrl.ala.org/dh/) called [Data Praxis](http://web.archive.org/web/20190411093756/http://acrl.ala.org/dh/category/data-praxis/), which he hopes will showcase folks working with humanities data at all steps in the pipeline.

An excerpt:

>**Based on your comments and prior blog posts such as, ["Tidy (Art) Historical Data"](/2015/09/23/tidy-art-historical-data.html), it seems that you put a great deal of care into thinking about how your data and research processes are documented and shared. Perhaps itâ€™s a bit of a brusque way to ask, but what made you care? How did you learn how to care? Who did you learn from?**
>
>I started caring because I saw smart people doing it. I still care because I experienced the practical benefits in a real way... On the other side of it, I've also had to deal with anti-patterns in documentation. Because I work almost exclusively with data that other people have assembled, I'm painfully conscious of how much the lack of documentation, and/or the assumption that people will only ever use your data the same way that you did, can hinder productive re-use of data.

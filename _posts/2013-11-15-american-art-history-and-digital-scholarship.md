Here are some live notes from the Smithsonian Institution Archives of American Art symposium ["American Art History and Digital Scholarship: New Avenues of Exploration"](http://www.aaa.si.edu/symposium):

(I'll note they have a very neat idea to have people sign up on large categorical posters ("Digital Pedagogy", "Data Mining" etc.) as a way to find lunch partners, and also a way to kick off a longer digital conversation.)

# Mapping Images

## Photogrammar

[Laura Wexler](https://twitter.com/laura_wexler) and [Lauren Tilton](https://twitter.com/NOLauren) presented their [Photogrammar] project that maps the locations of thousands of photographs taken during the Great Depression by the [Farm Security Administration][fsa]. Though the conventional wisdom is that FSA photos focused on the south and the dustbowl region, a national map of the actual photograph locations immediately challenged this assumption, presenting quite a different, diversified picture of where photographs were taken.. In Laura WExler's thoughtful words, the FSA project was not a document, but a *simulacrum* of the U.S. -- a representation without an "authentic" original.

Particularly exciting was when Laura Tilton started giving us a tour thought the map and started tracking individual photographers as they moved across the country. Also interesting was confronting the legacy classification tag system that comes with these photos. Intriguingly, different shots of the same scene could be sorted into completely different categories: a portrait-like image of a man is tagged "People as Such -- Middle-aged man", but an image of the *very same person* playing the piano becomes "Entertainment" -- how telling that formal, compositional changes can change completely our perception of the *content* of those images.

## Schematizing Landscape with the Inventory of American Paintings

[David Sledge](https://twitter.com/djsledge__) ([Williams College](https://williams.edu) represent!) wanted to see how he could use new tools and techniques to better contextualize images of American landscapes. 
He used the [Inventory of American Paintings](iap) compiled by the Smithsonian as a massive database of American landscape painting writ large.

David was particularly interested in understanding what locations American artists depicted. 
By mining the metadata of the IAP, he could draw out interesting trends in the numbers of artists painting particular subjects at any one time, with results that served as an invitation to new research.
For example, if New York was the most-painted city in American landscapes, why was Venice, Italy the second-most-painted? 
And if this surprises us (as it seemed to do for many in the auditorium), what does this say about lacunae in American art scholarship, about the assumptions that scholars have made about the grand narratives of American landscape painting?
He ended with a call for museums to release their databases not just in web forms designed for single-record lookup, but in raw forms that allow utterly different kinds of processing.

## Computational Analysis of Andy Warhol's Flowers

Marian Mazzone and Thomas Brady tried to apply computer image processing techniques in order to look at Andy Warhol.
For an art historian not interested in attribution questions or in differentiating style (as Marian says aptly, "I don't need a computer to do that for me, I can use my eyes"), what can computer vision give to us?
She turned to Warhol's flower series in part because there was a large body of materials (paintings as well as prints) to process, and since the images are based off of a single photograph, the differences between images can be more easily schematized and abstracted. 

Since computers are not yet useful for thinking about "style", Marian decided to simplify and ask basic schematic visual questions like "color". 
She wondered if we could detect patterns of changing artistic choices (e.g. color, rotation, scale) over a long series of works? 
Thomas Brady, a computer science undergraduate who partnered with her on this project, discussed how they got the computer to quickly record the flower colors of all the series images. 
Using this information, they were able to start counting up images with certain characteristics (flower size, flower color.) 
Though Marian and Thomas had not yet drawn conclusions from these data, they hope to combine this information with a network analysis of the movement of these images between galleries and collectors to see if any correlation can be found between formal properties and the exchange and distribution of these artworks.

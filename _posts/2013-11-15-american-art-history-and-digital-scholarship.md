## Photogrammar

[Laura Wexler](https://twitter.com/laura_wexler) and [Lauren Tilton](https://twitter.com/NOLauren) presented their [Photogrammar] project that maps the locations of thousands of photographs taken during the Great Depression by the [Farm Security Administration][fsa]. Though the conventional wisdom is that FSA photos focused on the south and the dustbowl region, a national map of the actual photograph locations immediately challenged this assumption, presenting quite a different, diversified picture of where photographs were taken.. In Laura WExler's thoughtful words, the FSA project was not a document, but a *simulacrum* of the U.S. -- a representation without an "authentic" original.

Particularly exciting was when Laura Tilton started giving us a tour thought the map and started tracking individual photographers as they moved across the country. Also interesting was confronting the legacy classification tag system that comes with these photos. Intriguingly, different shots of the same scene could be sorted into completely different categories: a portrait-like image of a man is tagged "People as Such -- Middle-aged man", but an image of the *very same person* playing the piano becomes "Entertainment" -- how telling that formal, compositional changes can change completely our perception of the *content* of those images.

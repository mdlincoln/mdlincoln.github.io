There are (at least?) four different summer institutes being offered this year in digital humanities specifically tailored for art historians.
Most are open to scholars of all levels and specialties, and they seek applicants of all digital skill levels.
For the sake of convenience, I've pulled together quick links and descriptions for all of the institutes here.

The [Getty Foundation](http://www.getty.edu/foundation/) is funding three separate institutes. All of these offer stipends covering travel and housing:

- June 16—June 27, 2014: [Beautiful Data at Harvard's metaLAB](http://metalab.harvard.edu/2014/01/beautiful-data-a-summer-institute-for-telling-stories-with-open-art-collections/). "Participants will be exposed to the core concepts, skills and practices necessary to make imaginative use of open collections data and assets, and to develop new forms of art-historical argument and storytelling that involve visualization, interactive media, expanded definitions of curatorial description, and hybrid analog/digital approaches to exhibition design and teaching." (Applications open now)
- July 7-18, 2014: [Digital Humanities for Art Historians at George Mason University](http://chnm.gmu.edu/news/getty-foundation-funds-a-digital-humanities-summer-institute-for-art-historians-at-rrchnm/). "'Digital Humanities for Art Historians' will target art historians, from graduate students, to mid-career and senior scholars, from varied backgrounds, including faculty, curators, and established art librarians and archivists who are eager to move more deeply into the digital turn in the humanities." (Applications open soon - you can [sign up for notifications here](http://chnm.gmu.edu/digital-humanities-for-art-historians-getty-foundation-2014-summer-institute/))
- July 28–August 6, 2014: [Beyond the Digitized Slide Library at UCLA](http://www.humanities.ucla.edu/getty/). "Participants will learn about debates and key concepts in the digital humanities and gain hands-on experience with tools and techniques for art historical research (including metadata basics, data visualization, network graphs, and digital mapping)." (Applications open now, due March 1st. **Note: open to faculty/staff only, no current graduate students**)

The [Kress Foundation](http://www.kressfoundation.org/) is sponsoring one institute.
Fellowships pay for tuition, room, board, and provide a travel stipend for all participants:

- August 3-15, 2014: [Summer Institute on Digital Mapping and Art History](http://www.kressfoundation.org/news/Article.aspx?id=35544&blogid=132): "Co-directed by Paul B. Jaskot (DePaul University) and Anne Kelly Knowles (Middlebury College), the Summer Institute will emphasize how digital mapping of art historical evidence can open up new veins of research in art history as a whole." (Applications open now, due March 3, 2014)

From this year's hosts for "Day of DH", Spain's [Universidad Nacional de EducaciÃ³n a Distancia](http://dayofdh2015.uned.es/about):

>A Day in the Life of the Digital Humanities (Day of DH) is an open community publication project that will bring together scholars interested in the digital humanities from around the world to document what they do on one day.

**9:34 AM**: First thing this morning I check on the status of an API-scraping script that I have been running for the past 48 hours in an attempt to harvest some museum data to incorporate into my [dissertation](/dissertation) project.

**10:15 AM**: Museum data has been on my mind quite a bit as I've prepared for a roundtable this Thursday on "Museusm in the Digital Age" at the [Cultural Programs of the National Academy of Sciences DASER forum](http://www.cpnas.org/events/daser-052115.html). Roger de Piles was quantifying style long before computer vision researchers started trying their hand at it.

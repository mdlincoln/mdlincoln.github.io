A stylish visualization has been making its way around the internet this week: [Edgard Barbarosa](http://www.behance.net/gallery/Books-of-Cities-Infographic/9188073) mined [Google's N-Gram viewer](http://books.google.com/ngrams) to visualize which cities are most name-dropped in novels over the last two centuries. You'll notice that this is actually the result of a school project assigned by [Professor Jeane Cooper](http://www.fau.edu/vaah/cooper.php) of Florida Atlantic University for a graphic design course. It makes me wonder if asking students to design visualizations of art history like this might actually make for a productive term assignment?

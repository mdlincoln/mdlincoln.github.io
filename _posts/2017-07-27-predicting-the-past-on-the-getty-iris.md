I have a new piece out on the Getty's _Iris_ introducing how historians - particularly art historians - are using computational modeling and sometimes even machine learning to predict the past:

>Computational simulations will never capture the full complexity of history—but then again, historians aren’t here to tell everything. We are here to distill evidence into a cogent argument. Explicit models, whether or not they use large datasets or machine learning, are a great help to historians in pursuit of this goal. Like an X-ray, a simplified model does flatten our view of the subject. But it also reveals a perspective that would otherwise have gone unseen.

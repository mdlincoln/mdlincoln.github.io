While some of our projects present complexity in data analysis, or others in the multilayered dance that is web development, sometimes they challenge us in unexpected ways and present edge cases to the kinds of services our library offers.

Dr. Stephen Wittek's (_Shakespeare VR_)[https://shx-vr.com] was one such project. From the project description:

>The Shakespeare-VR project uses virtual reality technologies to bring students face-to-face with professional actors performing Shakespearean soliloquies in a replica of Shakespeare’s Blackfriars Playhouse.

On the one hand, this project's needs were comparatively simple. It needed a straightforward, easy-to-edit, sustainable website where the project team could post links to the 360º videos they recorded at the Blackfriars Playhouse, as well as links to curricula and educational materials.

But the project presented a new (to me) data challenge - just what kinds of data do you need to save from a 360º video project? It was clear that we wanted to preserve copies of each of the finished, edited videos the team had filmed at the playhouse into CMU's institutional repository [KiltHub](https://kilthub.cmu.edu). But we also had the _raw_ video taken by each their camera rig's 17 cameras, as well as a host of other clips of audio and video, some snapped on a phone, during the filming day.

This also exposed lots of small usability issues in FigShare's offering. It's also helped us be more mindful about how we are asking researchers to document their deposits, as the "template" `README` was clearly designed primarily for someone with tabular data coming from a scientific instrument.

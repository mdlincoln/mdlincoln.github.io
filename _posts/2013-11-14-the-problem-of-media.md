Both John Michael Montias and Jonathan Israel, an economist and historian, respectively, have also suggested the direct influence of economic factors on both the subject matter as well as painting styles and market strategies of Dutch artists from this period, looking at data in probate inventories as well as price records for the raw materials that went into these paintings.[^4]

Moving to the [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) blogging platform doesn't save me a significant amount of time versus WordPress. But it is more customizable, and I'm choosing to count my now improved/refreshed Ruby, CSS, and webhosting knowledge towards the total value of the migration project (ergo I think I may still be on the good side of [this chart](http://xkcd.com/1205/).)

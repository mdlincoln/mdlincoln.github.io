During the first week of the Harvard MetaLab's 2015 workshop [_Beautiful Data II_](http://beautifuldata.metalab.harvard.edu), funded by the Getty Foundation, some conversations on the border between qualitative and quantitative analysis took off in the comments on Miriam Posner's post ["Humanities Data: A Contradiction"](http://miriamposner.com/blog/humanities-data-a-necessary-contradiction/).

This was total Matt-bait, but lucky for you all I instead channeled my response into a collaborative illustration experiment with Nuria Rodr√≠guez Ortega: [The Qualitative/Quantitative Duality: A Humanities Provocation](http://matthewlincoln.net/duality/).
Warning, jargon ahoy.
When in <strike>Rome</strike> Cambridge...

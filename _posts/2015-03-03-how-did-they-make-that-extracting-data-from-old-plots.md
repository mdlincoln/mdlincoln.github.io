One result from the latest [DHNow] editor's choice, ["Researcher Perspectives on Publication and Peer Review of Data"][plos][^1], really stuck out to me.
In surveying how researchers obtained previously-published data, Kratz and Strasser note, "Eight respondents (5%) wrote-in that they had obtained data through a channel we had not considered: extracting data from the text, tables, or figures of a published paper."

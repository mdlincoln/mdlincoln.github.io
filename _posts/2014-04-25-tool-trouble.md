As I noted [a few months ago][hiatus], I've been spending this semester preparing for my Ph.D comprehensive exams.
(T-minus ten days until they start, by the way.)
I tried mightily to focus myself on reading, and reading alone for the past few months.
And yet it is just too much fun to watch some of the great thinkers about visualization, network analysis, and academic labor, living vicariously through their blogs, talks, and tweets.
Thus, inevitably, I'd end up imbibing some from that intellectual stream before reeling myself back in (holy mixed metaphor, Batman!) back to seventeenth-century Dutch art history, knowing that I'd be able to return to this realm in high gear come summer, finally ready to devote some necessary time and attention to the question of art history's place in the digital humanities.

This is a suitably-roundabout way of apologizing for the rambling nature of this blog post, which I write (partially) in response to the latest issue of [*differences*][differences].[^1]
The editors devoted this issue (published this last week) to the theme "In the Shadows of the Digital Humanities", and its essays have prodded a few of my long-simmering ideas into some semblance of a shape.
Disclaimer: this essay has no trace of the theoretical apparatuses that the *differences* authors have all constructed for their contributions.
I admit to feeling like a complete interloper commenting on this kind of scholarship.
For better or worse, my graduate education has been relatively devoid of the kind of critical theory deployed with such ease in a venue like *differences* --- partly thanks to the predilections of my advisor, partly due to the curatorial inflection (even to this day) of a great deal of "serious" scholarship in early modern Dutch art history.

As seems to happen in almost any extended conversation about "the state" of the digital humanities, terms like "technological determinism" (Kirschenbaum, 53) and "posivitism" (Galloway, 109) slip into the discussion.
It is Alexander Galloway's contribution to this issue that I found most provocative, and, frankly, the most galling.
Exploring what he terms "The Cybernetic Hypothesis", Galloway posits that the digital humanities 

Scott Weingart [quickly noted][scottbot] his displeasure with this equation.
I agreed, particularly given Lisa Marie Rhody's strident demonstration *in the very same issue* that it is more often the self-styled opponents of DH that talk about positivism/determinism.
She rightly points out that from the beginning of "Digital Humanities" so-called, and deeply embedded in (just one!) of its ancestors, humanities computing, was a "reflective awareness of technology’s potential, as well as its dangers, and not a 'vapid embrace of the digital.'" (Rhody, 9)

Thanks to Rhody (and, really, countless others who have been saying this over and over), I think we can now move past this tired canard.
However I remain curious how Galloway's concept can persist in light of so much contrary evidence.
I wonder if the determinism/positivism trouble will persist as long we continue to refer to given computational approaches to humanistic subjects as "tools".

<!-- "Tool" inscribed by entry-level DH enthusiasm machines like THATCamp? (nod to Koh's article on politeness) -->

Like most things, Elijah Meeks may have best articulated this feeling when talking and writing about [ORBIS] and [Kindred Britain] --- that these digital constructions are "tools" only in the way that a monograph or a scholarly article are "tools".
That is to say (if I understand Elijah correctly) that a mature work of computational scholarship in the humanities not only acknowledges the methodological assumptions underpinning its models and logic (and here I we should think even at the level of coding), but makes clear to its readers that it presents a theoretical model for understanding its subject.

Corollary to the "tool" problem are several anxieties:

*If we use digital tools to answer questions, the only questions that will be answered are ones that can be answered with digital tools. When you have a hammer...*

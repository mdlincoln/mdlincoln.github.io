As I noted [a few months ago][hiatus], I've been spending this semester preparing for my Ph.D comprehensive exams.
(T-minus ten days until they start, by the way.)
I tried mightily to focus myself on reading, and reading alone for the past few months.
And yet it is just too much fun to watch some of the great thinkers about visualization, network analysis, and academic labor, living vicariously through their blogs, talks, and tweets.

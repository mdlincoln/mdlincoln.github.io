As I noted [a few months ago][hiatus], I've been spending this semester preparing for my Ph.D comprehensive exams.
(T-minus ten days until they start, by the way.)
I tried mightily to focus myself on reading, and reading alone for the past few months.
And yet it is just too much fun to watch some of the great thinkers about visualization, network analysis, and academic labor, living vicariously through their blogs, talks, and tweets.
Thus, inevitably, I'd end up imbibing some from that intellectual stream before reeling myself back in (holy mixed metaphor, Batman!) back to seventeenth-century Dutch art history, knowing that I'd be able to return to this realm in high gear come summer, finally ready to devote some necessary time and attention to the question of art history's place in the digital humanities.

This is a suitably-roundabout way of apologizing for the rambling nature of this blog post, which I write (partially) in response to the latest issue of [*differences*][differences].[^1]
The editors devoted this issue (published this last week) to the theme "In the Shadows of the Digital Humanities", and its essays have prodded a few of my long-simmering ideas into some semblance of a shape.
Disclaimer: this essay has vanishingly little of the theoretical apparatuses that the *differences* authors have all constructed for their contributions.
I admit to feeling like a complete interloper commenting on this kind of scholarship.
For better or worse, my graduate education has been relatively devoid of the kind of critical theory deployed with such ease in a venue like *differences* --- partly thanks to the predilections of my advisor, partly due to the curatorial inflection (even to this day) of a great deal of "serious" scholarship in early modern Dutch art history that tends to position connoisseurial judgments and archival research (however wrongly) as outside or apart from late twentieth-century critical theoretical concerns.

As seems to happen in almost any extended conversation about "the state" of the digital humanities, terms like "technological determinism" (Kirschenbaum, 53) and "positivism" (Galloway, 109) slip into the discussion.
It is Alexander Galloway's contribution to this issue that I found most provocative.
Galloway posits "The Cybernetic Hypothesis," suggesting that the tools of the digital humanities transcend a particular set of methodologies, and rather participate in a knowledge regime (125) connected to/complicit with:

1. The larger capitalist/neo-liberal hegemony (which Galloway invokes via the ["G" word](http://www.google.com))
2. The "deskilling" of the scholar from a person with the authority to "make claims" to a person dependent upon the outputs of devices.

As to the former, I find specified critiques of this relationship (e.g. the MOOC craze/debacle, or [complicity in academic funding][cecire]) far more satisfying than the bland assertion that defines the computer and computer user as a synecdoche of global capital and surveillance.
As to the latter, Scott Weingart [quickly noted][scottbot] his displeasure with this equation.
I agreed, particularly given Lisa Marie Rhody's strident demonstration *in the very same issue* that it is more often the self-styled opponents of DH that talk about positivism/determinism.
She rightly points out that from the beginning of "Digital Humanities" so-called, and deeply embedded in (just one!) of its ancestors, humanities computing, was a "reflective awareness of technology’s potential, as well as its dangers, and not a 'vapid embrace of the digital.'" (Rhody, 9)

I wonder, though, at the pernicious longevity of the techological positivism canard.
Why does Galloway succumb to it?
One passage in particular stood out to me:

> The digital humanities assume certain things about human subjects. While seeming to embed scholars and students more firmly in data, digital tools tend to do the opposite. Highly codified interfaces reduce the spectrum of possible input to a few keywords or algorithmic parameters. Those who were formerly scholars or experts in a certain area are now recast as mere tool users beholden to the affordances of the tool --- while students spend ever more time mastering menus and buttons, becoming literate in a digital device rather than a literary corpus. (127)


I wonder if the determinism/positivism trouble will persist as long we conceptualize computational approaches to humanistic subjects as if they were "tools".


"Tool" inscribed by entry-level DH enthusiasm machines like THATCamp? (nod to Koh's article on politeness)

Like most things, Elijah Meeks may have best articulated this feeling when talking and writing about [ORBIS] and [Kindred Britain] --- that these digital constructions are "tools" only in the way that a monograph or a scholarly article are "tools".
If I understand Elijah correctly, he means that a mature work of computational scholarship in the humanities not only acknowledges the methodological assumptions underpinning its models and logic (down to level of code architecture), but actually presents a theoretical model for understanding its subject.
The digital model does not lead one to an argument per se; it *is the argument*.


Corollary to the "tool" problem are several anxieties:

*If we use digital tools to answer questions, the only questions that will be answered are ones that can be answered with digital tools. When you have a hammer...*

Like many authors in *differences*, I am obliged to point out none of this is exactly new.
Matthew Kirschenbaum (hi UMD!) essentially summed this up in a tweet during the MLA session that seems to have inspired this issue:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>While we&#39;re acknowledging writing theory as making stuff, can we also acknowledge making stuff as doing theory? <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23s307&amp;src=hash">#s307</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23mla13&amp;src=hash">#mla13</a></p>&mdash; Matthew Kirschenbaum (@mkirschenbaum) <a href="https://twitter.com/mkirschenbaum/statuses/287280574815666177">January 4, 2013</a></blockquote>

Stephan Ramsay, Bethany Nowviskie have argued that theory is immanent of computational structure.
Adeline Koh touches on this thesis with her contribution critiquing the dual demands of technical knowledge and "niceness" --- elements she finds to be requirements to enter the digital humanities.

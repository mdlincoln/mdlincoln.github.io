[Sheila Brennan](https://twitter.com/sherah1918/status/355301842109992960) notes a new listing on GutHub devoted to museums active on the open source community: [Muse-tech-central](https://github.com/MuseCompNet/muse-tech-central).

Some neat-sounding projects include a tool four generating matching color palettes from an image (from the [Cooper-Hewitt](https://github.com/cooperhewitt/palette-server)) and a framework for online publishing of scholarly catalogs (from the [Indianapolis Museum of Art](https://github.com/IMAmuseum/ChicagoCodeX))

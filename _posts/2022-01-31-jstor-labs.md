After more than three and a half years at Carnegie Mellon University Libraries, I'm excited to be joining [JSTOR Labs](https://labs.jstor.org) as a senior software engineer for text and data mining.
Among other digital humanities projects, I'll be working on [Constellate](https://constellate.org/), their platform for making collections from both JSTOR and PORTICO available as data for text analysis teaching and research.

It's been a delight to work at CMU on a number of [innovative DH and digital libraries projects](/tags/cmu_dh) over the years.
My work with JSTOR will be fully remote, so I'll still be in Pittsburgh for the near future (how nice it is to not have to uproot life just for a job!)

The University of Maryland Libraries announced this summer, without any consultation with the faculty, that our art library of over 100,000 volumes (not to mention the architecture library next door) were to be closed and their collections integrated into the main research library.
Ours won't be the only subject-specific library to be consolidated, as the university, like many others, moves to reduce their physical holdings and shift more and more towards digital formats.

We are trying to stop that.

The idea of a "humanities lab" --- a social and intellectual (and maybe physical, too) space for humanities scholars to collaborate on projects *a la* the sciences --- has been circulating for [some time now][humanitieslabs].
The digital turn over the past decade has certainly added fuel to [many humanities labs initiatives][hlabsearch], not the least of which is own [Collaboratory for Visual Culture][Collaboratory] at the University of Maryland.

The humanities have had labs for quite some time, of course.
Our research libraries are spaces where we not only mine our archives for new discoveries, but also where we commune with the voices of our discipline past.
The subject-specific library, in particular, gathers together the full range of resources, in all their diverse subjects, genres, and formats, that would otherwise be scattered in a general collection.
More than simple convenience, the subject library also becomes a *locus* where every member of the department, from new grad students to the rarely-seen ABDers to the faculty, go by necessity to pursue their work.
We commune not only with our disciplinary past, there, but also with our living disciplinary present.
The library *is* our lab.

In her [letter](http://www.scribd.com/doc/235556221/Cronrath-Steele) announcing the plans to close our neighboring Architecture library, the dean of libraries quoted Ernest Cushing Richardson, librarian at Princeton at the turn of the century, as he wrote on the medieval library:

>It came to pass, therefore, that a single cathedral or monastery often had as many as half a dozen distinct collections, located at various points in church and cloisters, each intended for a special use; and besides this, there were also, here and there in the cloisters, small reading-desk with one or two books on each for general reading. The whole institution was thus in some sort a library, and to think of the ecclesiastical library as a single collection in a single place is to miss one of its most characteristic features.[^1]

This seemed an odd quotation in support of the argument for unifying collections such that the "onus of place" (in Dean Steele's words) no longer dictates our work.
Richardson's entire argument is that these collections are *inherently* spatial.
What is more, if you continue to read a few pages after this quote, Richardson goes on to show how the very process of navigating these spaces was replete with *human* interaction both chance and prolonged, from gatekeeper, to monk, to pilgrim, to beggar, to librarian.
What worries me in the motives for this closure is not merely the wish to centralize the collections, but the outlook on knowledge that seems to deny its embedededness in space, and thus its close bond with human interaction.

It is probably safe to say I work more with computational approaches and digital sources than anyone else in my department.
And yet I am equally reliant on the generations of knowledge stored in these volumes, as well as the present knowledge of my colleagues that I also find there.
If you shutter our library and disperse our collections, you are closing our lab, but you are also denying, in part, the very human practice of what we do.

Please, take a minute to [sign our petition][petition].

On November 19th-19th, 2016, the Huntington Library hosted a conference on ["Histories of Data and the Database"](http://www.huntington.org/historiesofdata/), convened by [Soraya de Chadarevian](http://socgen.ucla.edu/people/soraya-de-chadarevian/) and [Ted Porter](http://www.history.ucla.edu/faculty/theodore-porter) of UCLA. 
Their aims:

>In the age of internet searches and social media, data has become hotâ€”and not for the first time. An international group of historians will consider the promises, fears, practices, and technologies for recording and transmitting data in the 18th century to the present, including the implications for the lives of citizens and subjects.

I did a [selective livetweet of the conference](https://storify.com/matthewdlincoln/histories); some even more selective reflections follow.

This was a fun event to attend as an erstwhile DHer.
While these talks suffered from no lack of thoughtful critique, they were free of the anxious signaling that accompanies a lot of DH-adjacent presentations (my own included) in which data has to be problematized and defanged just enough to be used in the context of a humanistic question.
This is valuable, but it also feels like increasingly well-trodden ground.

Absent the burden of that kind of work, the speakers here unpacked "data" in a very different way, approaching it as a social phenomenon with many distinct permutations in different times and spaces.
One ensemble portrait that emerged was that data collection and databases need to be understood in a more nuanced light than the familiar Foucauldian lens of [biopower](http://www.iep.utm.edu/fouc-pol/#H7): data as a means of surveillance and control of the body.
While this is a crucial framework, actual instances of data generating and indexing practices show more complex relationships.

Andrew Mendelsohn walked us through instances of early modern data collection and indexing.

Sarah Igoe discussed the surprising history of the Social Security Number.
While today we are cautioned to guard the number carefully from identity theft, the first decades of the SSN were quite different.

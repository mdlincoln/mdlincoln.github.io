In an article forthcoming in next month's issue of *SOURCE: Notes in the History of Art*, I discuss the surprising answer to a seemingly-tiny question that arose during my fellowship last year at the National Gallery of Art's office of Northern Baroque paintings, as we were preparing to publish research on the recent acquisition of Gerrit van Honthorst's [*The Concert*][concert].

[concert]: http://www.nga.gov/content/ngaweb/Collection/art-object-page.163184.html

From the intro to the paper:

>According to most modern scholarship, it was during his time in Italy that Gerrit van Honthorst earned the nickname "Gherardo delle Notti," or "Gerrit of the nights," because of his talent for rendering dramatic nighttime images.
But when did Honthorst actually earn this name?
An investigation of archival sources suggests that "Gherardo delle Notti" may not be nearly as contemporary as has been assumed.

You can read the [full paper here][source].
In this post, I'd like to illuminate some of the digital roots of this research.

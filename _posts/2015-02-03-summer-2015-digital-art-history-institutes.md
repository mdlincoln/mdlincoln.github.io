Some of the [digital art history summer institutes][dah] from last year are returning for 2015!
At the moment, there are two announced institutes, both being funded by the Getty Foundation:

- July 13 --- July 24: [Building a Digital Portfolio](http://arthistory2015.doingdh.org/) at George Mason University: "Participants will learn from experienced RRCHNM and GMU faculty whose expertise span a range of digital humanities methodologies. Together with returning Project Co-Directors, Sheila Brennan and Sharon Leon, are Lisa Rhody, Stephanie Westcott, Lincoln Mullen, and Michele Greet." N.B.This institute is specifically open to students pursuing MAs or PhDs in art history. **Applications open February 9th.**

- July 5 --- July 15: [Beyond the Digitized Slide Library](http://www.humanities.ucla.edu/getty/) at the University of California, Los Angeles: Participants will learn about debates and key concepts in the digital humanities and gain hands-on experience with tools and techniques for art historical research (including metadata basics, data visualization, network graphs, and digital mapping)." N.B. current graduate students are not eligible to apply. **Applications are open now, and due March 1st.**

Obviously, I'm glad to update this post with any other summer programs that seem relevant.

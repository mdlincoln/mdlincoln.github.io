Some of the [digital art history summer institutes][dah] from last year are returning for 2015!
At the moment, there are two announced institutes, both being funded by the Getty Foundation:

- July 13 --- July 24: [Building a Digital Portfolio](http://arthistory2015.doingdh.org/): "Participants will learn from experienced RRCHNM and GMU faculty whose expertise span a range of digital humanities methodologies. Together with returning Project Co-Directors, Sheila Brennan and Sharon Leon, are Lisa Rhody, Stephanie Westcott, Lincoln Mullen, and Michele Greet." N.B.This institute is specifically open to students pursuing MAs or PhDs in art history. Applications open February 9th.
- July 5 -- July 15: [Beyond the Digitized Slide Library](http://www.humanities.ucla.edu/getty/): "Beyond the Digitized Slide Library is an eight-day summer institute at the University of California, Los Angeles, July 5â€“15, 2015. Major support for the program is provided by the Getty Foundation. Participants will learn about debates and key concepts in the digital humanities and gain hands-on experience with tools and techniques for art historical research (including metadata basics, data visualization, network graphs, and digital mapping)." N.B. current graduate students are not eligible to apply. Applications are open now, and due March 1st.

Obviously, I'm glad to update this post with any other summer programs that seem relevant.

Some of the [digital art history summer institutes][dah] from last year are returning for 2015!
The Getty has renewed funding for these three institutes:

- July 5 --- July 15: [Beyond the Digitized Slide Library](https://ucla-beyond-slide-library.github.io/DAH101/About.html) at the University of California, Los Angeles: Participants will learn about debates and key concepts in the digital humanities and gain hands-on experience with tools and techniques for art historical research (including metadata basics, data visualization, network graphs, and digital mapping)." N.B. current graduate students are not eligible to apply. **Applications are open now, and due March 1st.**

- July 6 --- July 16: [Beautiful Data II](http://beautifuldata.metalab.harvard.edu/) at Harvard University: "With art museums making both their imagery and collections data open and accessible, a question arises: what to do with it all? Participants will be introduced to concepts and skills necessary to make use of open collections to develop art-historical storytelling through data visualization, interactive media, enhanced curatorial description and exhibition practice, digital publication, and data-driven, object-oriented teaching." **Applications are open now, and due March 1st.**

- July 13 --- July 24: [Building a Digital Portfolio](http://arthistory2015.doingdh.org/) at George Mason University: "Participants will learn from experienced RRCHNM and GMU faculty whose expertise span a range of digital humanities methodologies. Together with returning Project Co-Directors, Sheila Brennan and Sharon Leon, are Lisa Rhody, Stephanie Westcott, Lincoln Mullen, and Michele Greet." N.B.This institute is specifically open to students pursuing MAs or PhDs in art history. **Applications open February 9th.**



Obviously, I'm glad to update this post with any other summer programs that seem relevant.

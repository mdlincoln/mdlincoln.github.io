I just signed up for a beta invite to this [collaborative network mapping platform](http://graphcommons.com/). One of its developers, Burak Arıkan, just published a [short note](http://dx.doi.org/10.1162/LEON_a_00567) in a special section of the latest _Leonardo_ devoted to arts, humanities and complex networks.

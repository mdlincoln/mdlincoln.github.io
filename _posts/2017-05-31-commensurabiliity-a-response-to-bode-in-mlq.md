I read with great interest “The Equivalence of ‘Close’ and ‘Distant’ Reading; Or, Toward a New Object for Data-Rich Literary History,” by  Katherine Bode in the latest _MLQ_.[^bode] (h/t [Alan Liu](https://twitter.com/alanyliu/status/869782911746289664))

[^bode]: Katherine Bode, “The Equivalence of ‘Close’ and ‘Distant’ Reading; Or, Toward a New Object for Data-Rich Literary History,” _Modern Language Quarterly_ 78, no. 1 (March 1, 2017): 77–106, doi:[10.1215/00267929-3699787](https://dx.doi.org/10.1215/00267929-3699787). ([open-access pre-print](https://katherinebode.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/bode-article_mlq_final.pdf)) https://katherinebode.wordpress.com/articles-chapters/

Bode presents a trenchant critique of both close and distant reading by way of source criticism, emphasizing that the Moretti/Jockers rehetoric relies on the problematic assumption of commensurability of texts.

What does the result look like, however?

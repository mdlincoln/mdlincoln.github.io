I'm going to be plowing through Neal Stephenson's [_Anathem_](http://www.worldcat.org/title/anathem/oclc/191930336) this summer, hopefully with a bit more success than my attempts to tackle the exhausting [_Reamde_](http://www.worldcat.org/title/reamde/oclc/703206576) last year. I suspect having an e-reader will help things go more smoothly, considering both fall in the weightlifting category  of tome at 1000+ pages each.

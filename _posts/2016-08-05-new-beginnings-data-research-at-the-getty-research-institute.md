Today marked my first week on the job as the Getty Research Institute's new Data Research Specialist!

I will be working on a multi-year project to remodel the [Provenance Index databases](http://www.getty.edu/research/tools/provenance/), an effort combining talent from the art historical, librarian, archival, programming, design, and user experience staff at the Getty.
Among these wonderful folks is [Rob Sanderson, a semantic architect](http://blogs.getty.edu/iris/a-conversation-with-the-gettys-new-semantic-architect/) who will be working on efforts to bridge the many data silos at the J. Paul Getty Trust together, and to allow users around the world to more easily connect to not only the provenance databases, but knowledge stores across all the Getty's programs.

Please do be in touch if you're interested in the kinds of work that we will be trying to do here!

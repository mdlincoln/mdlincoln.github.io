My advisor, Arthur Wheelock, [celebrates his 40th year of teaching][celebration] at the University of Maryland this Saturday.
This comes just a few short weeks after he and his team at the National Gallery of art released the second edition of the systematic catalog of the [Dutch paintings of the seventeenth century][oed].
This is the first born-digital collection catalog published by the Gallery, and the architects have done a wonderful job in creating an interface that presents texts with its interlinked images as well as I've seen it done to date.
(Be sure to check out the image viewer for a work like Vermeer's [*Girl with the Red Hat*][vermeer], which has a very useful feature that allows you to pan and zoom the artwork under visible light and x-radiography simultaneously.)

<figcaption>Compare the creation dates of artworks entering the gallery in different eras. 95% of the Mellon and Widener collections (marked by the vertical range labeled "Core") fall between the late 1630s and 1670, while 95% of paintings entering the gallery under Wheelock's tenure cover a much wider range.</figcaption>

<figcaption>Breaking down the collection by genre clearly demonstrates the preferences and preconceptions that Mellon and Widener held about the nature of Dutch art.</figcaption>

<figcaption>Even physical size of paintings is a matter of taste. Mellon's Dutch collections tended towards similar sizes, and were largely oriented as landscapes. Widener's collection had more diversity of scale, and his core collection of small pieces served as a foundation for Wheelock's many additions that now fill the suitably-scaled cabinet galleries.</figcaption>

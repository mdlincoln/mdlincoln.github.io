A recent piece in _The Guardian_ quotes extensively from Brian Allen, a former director of the Paul Mellon Centre for Studies in British Art, who frets that academic art history's focus on the social history of art is causing a connoisseurship crisis:

>He now fears that other subject areas "will fall into obscurity". "If you look at the number of doctoral theses being produced in pre-20th-century art, it’s diminishing very rapidly. People are opting to do what you might call easier subject areas. If you’re writing about contemporary art, you don’t really need a body of knowledge to the same extent."
>
>Now, Allen claims, some of the best scholars coming through in the field of British art are from Italy, where, he says, they have a much more conventional classical education: "They’re better equipped to deal with the rigours of older art where you have to know languages, classical mythology, Greek and Roman history," he says. "So many of our [art history] students these days have got almost none of those fundamental skills. It’s simply the way education has changed."

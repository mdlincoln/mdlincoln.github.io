As a first time attendee, I didn't know entirely what to expect, other than lots of digital and museums.
The program is really quite diverse, and ranged from relatively technical discussions (sometimes dry; sometimes hilarious) to more meta-professional sessions that really did function as a kind of group therapy.

I want to focus in on one question in one session in particular, though.
At a panel on funders' perspectives, program officers from the Kress Foundation, the Knight Foundation, !$#$, and the Pew Foundation in Philadelphia gathered to discuss what they look for in a grant application for digital and technology initiative sin museums.
One question asked about standards: given museums' predilection to build their own bespoke services.

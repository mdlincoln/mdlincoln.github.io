[Today's *Chronicle* article][chron] on the (maybe?) shifting direction of the Mellon Foundation brings up the now-ubiquitous question of graduate training in the humanities.
Naturally, the digital humanities get a brief nod from Mellon VP MariÃ«t Westermann, who notes:

>"Not everyone's going to love the digital humanities, nor probably does everyone have to, but it would be good to begin to build the opportunity to develop that competency right into doctoral education rather than waiting till 10 years out" from graduate school to do it.

I'm all for that.
And this training need not be in digital methods alone.
Many more professional competencies need to be a part graduate education, and I think the more that faculty manage to weave this training directly into their courses, the better.
(I see this being more engaging than, say, holding an independent workshop --- though those would be better than nothing!)
Had even one of my graduate seminars asked me to, say, draft a humanities project proposal, rather than write up yet another research paper, I would have been much better equipped when I dove into my very first attempt at a grant proposal last summer.
(Alan Liu's prospectus assignment for his graduate course [Digital Humanities: Introduction to the Field](http://eng236introdh2013fstudentwork.pbworks.com/w/page/71237948/Project%20Prospectuses) is just one of many examples of this kind of seminar project.)

Juggling image rights is certainly one of an art historian's professional requirements.
Having gotten to the dreaded image rights stage of a book project this year, Shannon Mattern delegated the logistics to a graduate research assistant, and wrote out a detailed guide on how to manage the process, including a template request letter and instructions on how to record the status of each request.
Rather than keeping this guide tucked away for the next book project, Mattern shared the guide in an [eminently-bookmarkable post on her blog][rights].

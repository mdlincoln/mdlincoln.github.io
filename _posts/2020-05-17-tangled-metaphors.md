After years of hard work by editor Kathryn Brown, [_The Routledge Companion to Digital Humanities and Art History_](https://doi.org/10.4324/9780429505188) is finally out!

It was almost three years ago that Dr. Brown invited me to contribute an appraisal of network analysis methods in art history. Like any review paper, by the time it finally appears "in print" citations are out of date. However I still stand by the thrust of the survey, ["Tangled Metaphors"](https://doi.org/10.4324/9780429505188-9): that it's a relatively small portion of art historical network analysis that actually takes advantage of measures available only through network computations to gain a new perspective on a set of historical sources:

>I aim to shift attention to art-historical work that has engaged with the most fundamentally transformative aspects of networks: that measurements one can make of a network transcend the mere sum of its individual constituents and their interconnections. These are studies that directly engage concepts from network mathematics, using computation as a way to evaluate evidence in ways not accessible through argumentation via case study or even non-network-based quantitative approaches like counting and averaging. I will identify early prototypes for this type of more formalized art-historical network thinking, and then point to a few recent examples of network analysis that push these methodological boundaries in useful ways.

In the chapter I chart forebears for network thinking in art history, including some much lesser known works besides Alfred Barr's iconic _Cubism and Abstract Art_ diagram.

I have finally gotten around to releasing the code I used to generate my [painting network graph](/2013/11/12/networks-of-the-smithsonian-american-art-museum.html) of the Smithsonian American Art Museum.

[You can see it here.](https://github.com/mdlincoln/saam)

I had meant to push this out in time for the [Archives of American Art symposium](/2013/11/15/american-art-history-and-digital-scholarship.html), but things got put on the back burner and when the symposium arrived, I realized I hadn't put much of any commenting or documentation in the repository at all -- neither in careful commenting in the source code, nor in a `README` file.

Finally putting this together, I got curious if there were best practices for uploading code made for digital humanities (or any kind of academic) work.

More and more journals are moving to GitHub or the like as [code repositories](http://caseybergman.wordpress.com/2012/11/08/on-the-preservation-of-published-bioinformatics-code-on-github/).

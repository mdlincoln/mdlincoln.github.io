I have finally gotten around to [releasing the code](https://github.com/mdlincoln/saam) I used to generate my [painting network graph](/2013/11/12/networks-of-the-smithsonian-american-art-museum.html) of the Smithsonian American Art Museum. Some more charts of the trends in various keywords over time [can be found here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AsjvWNf_U5QbdF9fbVBUM1FIMXVlMU5WVTlEX2pqckE&usp=sharing).

I had meant to push this out in time for the [Archives of American Art symposium](/2013/11/15/american-art-history-and-digital-scholarship.html), but things got put on the back burner and when the symposium arrived, I realized I hadn't put much of any commenting or documentation in the repository at all -- neither in careful commenting in the source code, nor in a `README` file.
This is a no-no of course -- you really should be good about commenting as you go, especially for the benefit of **future**-you.
The goal of adding in these comments is also to make sure that someone who can come along later might actually be able to *reproduce* what I did in analyzing the SAAM collections.
On the importance of such reproduction, see this excellent article just out on ["Ten Simple Rules for Reproducible Computational Research"](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003285).

Now that I've finally gotten around to putting this together, I got curious if there were best practices for uploading code made for digital humanities (or any kind of academic) work, especially as more and more journals are moving to GitHub or the like as [code repositories](http://caseybergman.wordpress.com/2012/11/08/on-the-preservation-of-published-bioinformatics-code-on-github/).
So if you know of any such resources, please let me know in the comments!

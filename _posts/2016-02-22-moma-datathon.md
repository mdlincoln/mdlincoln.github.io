I had the pleasure to serve as a judge for a "datathon" hosted by the Museum of Modern Art this weekend, organized by [Lauren Nor√©n](http://web.archive.org/web/20200804205739/https://about.me/lauranoren) (NYU).
One of my co-judges, Alise Tifentale, put together a [nice writeup here](http://www.alisetifentale.net/research-blog-at/2016/2/21/judging-the-artdatathon-at-the-museum-of-modern-art).

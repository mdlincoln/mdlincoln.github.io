>The utterly unlucky choice of the term 'metadata', for cultural data, assuming that the material cultural object is the real 'data', actually degrades curatorial knowledge to an auxiliary retrieval function without scientific merit, as if one could 'read out' all curatorial knowledge just by contemplating the object, in analogy to reading a book.


>Museums, by their nature, remove the object from its historical context and "replaces history with classification". Curators, almost battling against the forces of their own environment, attempt to return objects back into their own original time and space, a responsibility difficult to achieve within the "hermetic world" of the museum gallery (Stewart, 1993, p.152), and particularly amongst a largely passive and untargeted mixture of physical 'browsers'.

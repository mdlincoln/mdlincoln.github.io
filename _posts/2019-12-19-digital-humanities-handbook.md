We here at CMU are huge fans of static sites for many reasons.
By creating websites that build as a bunch of flat files, it's very simple to put the end result on a vanilla webserver and not have to worry about maintaining and updating a database service, a web app service, a messaging pipeline, etc.

They can often be a very good match for a digital humanities project if that project's output is a catalogue-like thing: a collection of content, perhaps with some repeatable types, where the authors need a few good pre-defined templates, and the content pipeline just needs to be them uploading and editing simple files or datasets that can be straightforwardly transformed into webpages.
Once transformed and put online, even if the entire project and technical team got hit by a bus, the webpages will still basically *work* without much intervention needed.
Because the files are version controlled, it is also possible to add and edit content in the future

For that reason, we try to funnel many of our projects with a web-based deliverable into a static site solution, including our [Shakespeare VR project](https://dh-web.hss.cmu.edu/shakespeare_vr/), the [NGA Visual Neighbors project](https://dh-web.hss.cmu.edu/nga/), and the [_Digital Humanities Literacy Guidebook_](https://cmu-lib.github.io/dhlg/).

The _DHLG_, as we like to call it, is one of the key outputs of the A.W. Mellon grant to CMU to kickstart the digital humanities here.
It's a summation of many of the resources and research that is taught at the [summer DH workshops]().
To quote from Scott Weingart's description of it:

>The DHLG is your slim guidebook into this world, like the tourist map they give you when you check in at a hotel. Use it to get your bearings, plot your course, and find the resources that will help you explore further.

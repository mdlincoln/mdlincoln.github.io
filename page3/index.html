	<p><a href="/assets/images/rembrandt_google_doodle.png"><img src="/assets/images-display/rembrandt_google_doodle.png" alt="rembrandt google doodle" title="2013-07-15 Google doodle featuring Rembrandt's 1659 self-portrait now in the National Gallery of Art in Washington DC" /></a></p>

<p>Today’s <a href="http://www.google.com/doodles">Google doodle</a> celebrates Rembrandt van Rijn’s birthday 407 years ago in Leiden, and features one of his haunting <a href="http://www.nga.gov/fcgi-bin/tinfo_f?acc=1937.1.72">late self-portraits</a> that hangs today in the National Gallery of Art in Washington.</p>

<p>Sadly, Google missed out on an opportunity to make an even more delightful visual pun with Rembrandt’s slightly later c. 1665 self-portrait now in the Kenwood House in London, which features two circles that would fit perfectly into the middle of a large, painterly “G<strong>oo</strong>gle”.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/images/rembrandt_1665_kenwood.jpg"><img src="/assets/images-display/rembrandt_1665_kenwood.png" alt="rembrandt kenwood house 1665 self-portrait" title="Rembrandt's c. 1665 self-portrait now in the Kenwood House in London" /></a></p>

<p>If they had chosen this self-portarit, Google would have added yet another layer to these enigmatic circles, which have spurred no small amount of scholarly debate over the decades.</p>

<p>It was B. P. J. Broos who established in 1971 what is likely the best explanation for the circles: that they allude to stories of past master artists famed for their skill with line.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> The legendary artists of Greek antiquity, Apelles and Protogenes, were said to have competed with each other over who could paint the finest, most perfect line. This trope of linear mastery gained its own twist in Karel van Mander’s seventeenth-century biography of the early Italian renaissance painter Giotto. Van Mander tells us how Giotto demonstrated his skill to a representative of a potential patron, Pope Benedict IX:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Giotto was witty; he took a sheet of paper and holding his arm against his side to act as a compass, he drew on it, with a turn of the hand, never moving his arm, a circle so perfect that it was a wonder to see. Having done this, he gave it to the courtier with a grin, saying: there is the drawing. Whereupon the courtier, thinking himself made fun of, answered: am I to have no other drawing than this? This is more than enough, said Giotto, show it to the Pope with the rest, and you shall see whether or not it will be appreciated. He left ill-satisfied. When this drawing came before the Pope among others, and when he had been told in what manner it was drawn by Giotto, without a compass 
and with a stiff arm, the Pope and his many judicious courtiers understood that Giotto was the best painter of his time.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">2</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Broos showed how the perfect circle shows up again and again in Dutch images from the period, such as Rembrandt’s <a href="http://www.nga.gov/content/ngaweb/Collection/art-object-page.9961.html">1658 etched portrait</a> of the virtuoso Amsterdam calligrapher Lieven Willemszoon van Coppenol. So while Rembrandt shows us an aged, somewhat disheveled figure in the foreground of this self-portrait, the background reminds us that behind that timeworn face is a skilled, modern-day artist who can match the feats of the old masters, and remain in the history books, not to mention museums, more than four centuries later.</p>

	<p>Moving to the <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> blogging platform doesn’t save me a significant amount of time versus WordPress. But it is more customizable, and I’m choosing to count my now improved/refreshed Ruby, CSS, and webhosting knowledge towards the total value of the migration project (ergo I think I may still be on the good side of <a href="http://xkcd.com/1205/">this chart</a>.)</p>

<div class="content">
	<p>The abstracts for Digital Humanities 2013 at the University of Nebraska, Lincoln <a href="http://dh2013.unl.edu/abstracts">have been posted</a>. Some standouts:</p>

<h1 id="network-analysis">Network analysis</h1>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://dh2013.unl.edu/abstracts/ab-417.html"><strong>Six Degrees of Francis Bacon</strong></a>: Unsurprisingly, this fascinating project is making a showing at DH2013. Their abstract is a wonderfully concise explanation of the value of this project, and they describe very ambitious-sounding plans for eventually expanding their scope beyond the Dictionary of National Biogrpahy.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://dh2013.unl.edu/abstracts/ab-378.html"><strong>Preliminaries: The Social Networks of Literary Production in the Spanish Empire During the Administration of the Duke of Lerma (1598-1618)</strong></a>: I really wish I could see this one, as the authors are asking questions very similar to my exploration of artist networks described by existing structured art historical databases. They deal with characterizing the interaction (or conspicuous separation) of different neighborhoods, and even individuals, in their network model.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://dh2013.unl.edu/abstracts/ab-251.html"><strong>Extraction and Analysis of Character Interaction Networks From Plays and Movies</strong></a>: The authors offer several possible ways to characterize narrative structure in plays and movies by analyzing networks of character interactions, from <em>Hamlet</em> to <em>Charlie’s Angels</em>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h1 id="art-history">Art History</h1>

<p>(surprise, just 7 abstracts in the <a href="http://dh2013.unl.edu/abstracts/topic.html?q=topic:%22art%20history%7C%7Cart%20history%22">art history topic</a> out of a total 236!)</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://dh2013.unl.edu/abstracts/ab-206.html"><strong>Not Exactly Prima Facie: Understanding the Representation of the Human Through the Analysis of Faces in World Painting</strong></a>: Face-detection is one of the better-developed branches of computer image recognition (<a href="http://www.facebook.com">obviously</a>). The authors describe an interesting process of abstracting clusters of similar facial feature sets from a base of 22,000-odd images. It will be interesting to see if and how these clusters map onto existing histories of style. However I am rather more confused how this new, interesting abstraction will, in their words, move art history “beyond the generalizations supported by the notions of ‘style’, ‘genre’ and ‘national history’”</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://dh2013.unl.edu/abstracts/ab-127.html"><strong>Evaluating Natural Light in Historic Structures through Digital Simulation</strong></a>: These authors are interested in the capability of simulation to tell us about natural light effects in future buildings - I hope everyone visiting this poster asks them about lighting analysis with digital reconstructions of historic buildings! What might natural lighting have been like in the Baths of Caracalla?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://dh2013.unl.edu/abstracts/ab-243.html"><strong>Reverse Image Lookup, Paintings, Digitisation, Reuse</strong></a>: If you google image search a bunch of London National Gallery images, where do they go? I’m glad to see they have found evidence that openly disseminating images drives visitors to the source website of the museum - hopefully a good argument for more open access initiatives like those at the <a href="http://images.nga.gov">National Gallery of Art</a> and the <a href="https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/nl/rijksstudio">Rijksmuseum</a>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h1 id="gis">GIS</h1>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://dh2013.unl.edu/abstracts/ab-133.html"><strong>A Clear Temporal GIS Viewer and Software for Discovering Irregularities in Historical GIS</strong></a> and <a href="http://dh2013.unl.edu/abstracts/ab-319.html"><strong>Issues in Spatio-Temporal Technologies for the Humanities and Arts</strong></a>: I’m glad to see a few panels addressing challenges in visualizing dynamic geographic information using current software.</li>
